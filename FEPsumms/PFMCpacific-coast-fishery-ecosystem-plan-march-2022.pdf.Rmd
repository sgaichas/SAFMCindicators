## Summary of the Pacific Coast Fishery Ecosystem Plan (500 words)

The Pacific Coast Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP) for the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) represents a comprehensive framework adopted by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) to enhance species-specific management with ecosystem-based approaches. First adopted in 2013 and updated in March 2022, this plan addresses the entire U.S. portion of the CCE, spanning from southern British Columbia to Baja California.

The FEP operates under a vision of a thriving, resilient California Current Ecosystem that provides sustainable benefits for current and future generations while supporting diverse fishing opportunities and community well-being. The plan's primary purpose is to integrate ecosystem science across the Council's four Fishery Management Plans (FMPs): Coastal Pelagic Species, Groundfish, Highly Migratory Species, and Salmon.

The CCE is characterized as a dynamic eastern boundary current system dominated by seasonal upwelling and high productivity. The plan recognizes three major biogeographic subregions: Northern (Cape Flattery to Cape Blanco), Central (Cape Blanco to Point Conception), and Southern (Point Conception to U.S.-Mexico border). Each region exhibits distinct oceanographic features, habitat types, and species assemblages influenced by varying upwelling intensity, continental shelf width, and freshwater inputs.

The ecosystem encompasses diverse habitats from mountain streams in Idaho to the outer boundary of the Exclusive Economic Zone, supporting everything from phytoplankton and kelp forests to marine mammals and highly migratory species. Commercial, recreational, and tribal fisheries are economically and culturally significant, with Dungeness crab being the most valuable fishery by revenue, followed by Pacific whiting by volume.

Key management challenges include climate variability and change, marine heatwaves, ocean acidification, and interactions between fisheries and protected species. The 2014-2016 marine heatwave demonstrated the ecosystem's vulnerability to extreme events, causing unprecedented changes in species distributions, harmful algal blooms, and marine mammal entanglements in fishing gear.

The plan addresses ecosystem-based management through six primary goals: (1) providing framework and public forum for ecosystem information in decision-making, (2) conserving species populations and ecological relationships, (3) ensuring continued ecosystem services for community well-being, (4) protecting and restoring marine habitat diversity, (5) managing fisheries to support protected species recovery, and (6) promoting climate-adaptive management.

Annual processes include Ecosystem Status Reports presented each March and ecosystem initiatives addressing cross-FMP issues. Completed initiatives include prohibiting new fisheries on unfished forage species (CEBA 1), coordinated ecosystem indicator review, and climate and communities scenario planning.

The FEP emphasizes the social-ecological nature of the system, recognizing that human communities and marine ecosystems are interconnected. Fishing communities along the coast vary in their dependence on marine resources and social vulnerability, with management needing to balance conservation objectives with community needs.

Looking forward, the plan acknowledges emerging challenges including offshore energy development, aquaculture expansion, and continued climate change effects. It calls for enhanced integration of ecosystem information into stock assessments, development of climate-ready management strategies, and improved understanding of trophic relationships and predator-prey dynamics.

The FEP serves as both an informational document and a framework for coordinated action across multiple jurisdictions, recognizing that effective ecosystem-based management requires collaboration among federal, state, tribal, and international partners. It represents a significant evolution from single-species management toward holistic ecosystem approaches that account for the complex interactions within the California Current system.
