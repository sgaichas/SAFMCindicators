# Summary of Pacific Remote Island Areas Fishery Ecosystem Plan

This Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP) for the Pacific Remote Island Areas (PRIA) represents a significant shift from species-based to place-based ecosystem management for federal waters around Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Palmyra Atoll, and Wake Island. The plan consolidates existing management regulations for demersal fisheries (bottomfish, coral reef ecosystem, crustaceans, and precious corals) while establishing a framework for implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management.

The PRIA FEP encompasses federal waters (0-200 nm) around these remote islands and maintains existing fishing regulations without introducing new restrictions. Current fishing activity is minimal, with only occasional bottomfish, crustacean, and recreational fishing occurring. The plan establishes Marine Protected Areas including no-take zones around Baker, Howland, Jarvis, and Kingman, and low-use zones around Johnston, Palmyra, and Wake.

Key features include federal permit and reporting requirements for all demersal fishing, gear restrictions prohibiting destructive methods, and requirements for selective gear only. The plan emphasizes adaptive management, community participation, and coordination with other federal agencies managing the PRIA. Essential Fish Habitat designations protect critical marine environments from the shoreline to various depths depending on species requirements.

The FEP identifies 10 overarching objectives focusing on maintaining biodiversity, implementing adaptive management, improving public awareness, encouraging community participation, minimizing bycatch, managing protected species and habitats, promoting safety, ensuring compliance, increasing collaboration, and improving information availability.

## Ecosystem Policies, Goals, and Objectives

### **Overall Goal**
Establish a framework to improve the Council's abilities to realize MSA goals through incorporation of ecosystem science and principles.

### **Ecosystem Policies/Principles** (from EPAP)
1. The ability to predict ecosystem behavior is limited
2. Ecosystems have real thresholds and limits
3. Changes can be irreversible once thresholds are exceeded
4. Diversity is important to ecosystem functioning
5. Multiple scales interact within and among ecosystems
6. Components of ecosystems are linked
7. Ecosystem boundaries are open
8. Ecosystems change with time
