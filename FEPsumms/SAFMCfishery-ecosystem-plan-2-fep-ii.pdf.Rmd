# Comprehensive Summary: South Atlantic Fishery Ecosystem Plan II

## Executive Summary (500 words)

The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) approved Fishery Ecosystem Plan II (FEP II) in March 2018 as a comprehensive framework to incorporate ecosystem principles into fishery management processes across the South Atlantic region from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to the Florida Keys. This living document, compiled in February 2024, encompasses approximately 174,331 kmÂ² extending from intertidal zones to 500m depth.

**Ecosystem-Based Management Approach**: FEP II emphasizes ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), explicitly considering indirect effects through food web processes, habitat connectivity, and integration of environmental and human factors. The plan recognizes three interconnected food webs: estuarine systems dominated by seagrasses and detritus-based energy flow; nearshore mixed soft/hard bottom habitats; and offshore live/hard bottom habitats supporting commercially important reef fish complexes.

**Species and Habitat Management**: The plan provides comprehensive management for SAFMC-managed species including snapper-grouper complexes, coastal migratory pelagics, shrimp, spiny lobster, and coral. Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) designations encompass critical habitats from shallow coral reefs to deep-water environments, with Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPCs) protecting spawning aggregation sites, nursery areas, and vulnerable ecosystems like the Oculina Bank.

**Climate Change Adaptation**: Climate variability emerges as a major management consideration, with documented impacts including species distribution shifts, phenological changes, altered recruitment patterns, and increased disease prevalence. The plan emphasizes adaptive management strategies incorporating climate indicators and addressing ocean acidification, sea level rise, and temperature-driven ecosystem changes.

**Threats and Challenges**: Major stressors include habitat degradation from coastal development, invasive species (particularly Indo-Pacific lionfish), disease outbreaks affecting coral reefs, flow alterations from dams and water diversions, and cumulative impacts from multiple human activities. The ongoing coral disease outbreak is described as "one of the most lethal ever recorded."

**Food Web Connectivity**: The plan emphasizes critical energy transfer pathways mediated by forage species like menhaden, anchovies, and small pelagic fish. These species serve as essential links between primary production and higher trophic levels, supporting both commercial fisheries and marine wildlife including seabirds and marine mammals.

**Management Tools**: The framework integrates Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), Special Management Zones (SMZs), ecosystem modeling (Ecopath with Ecosim), and indicator-based monitoring systems. Management approaches range from zero-take regulations for sensitive species to adaptive quotas incorporating environmental variability.

**Research Priorities**: Critical knowledge gaps include forage fish ecology, climate impact assessments, offshore habitat characterization, basic life history data for non-commercial species, and development of ecosystem-level reference points. The plan prioritizes standardized monitoring through programs like SEAMAP and emphasizes the need for ecosystem-level risk assessments.

**Policy Integration**: Comprehensive policies address energy development, marine aquaculture, flow alterations, invasive species control, and habitat protection. These policies provide guidance for avoiding, minimizing, and mitigating impacts while supporting sustainable fisheries and ecosystem resilience. The plan serves as an umbrella document coordinating ecosystem considerations across all SAFMC fishery management plans.
