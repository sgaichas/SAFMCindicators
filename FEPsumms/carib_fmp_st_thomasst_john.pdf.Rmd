# Comprehensive Summary: St. Thomas/St. John Fishery Ecosystem Plan

## Executive Summary (500 words)

The St. Thomas/St. John Fishery Management Plan represents a transformative shift from Caribbean-wide to island-based fisheries management in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Developed by the Caribbean Fishery Management Council in 2019, this comprehensive plan addresses federal waters extending from 3 to 200 nautical miles around St. Thomas and St. John, establishing management for diverse marine resources in one of the most ecologically and economically important fishing regions in the U.S. Caribbean.

**Management Structure:** The plan transitions from managing 81 finfish species under four separate Caribbean-wide FMPs to a streamlined approach managing 47 finfish species, plus spiny lobster, queen conch, and all corals, sea cucumbers, and sea urchins found in the area. Species are organized into 26 management units comprising 12 individual stocks and 14 stock complexes, with indicator species selected for complex management based on biological, ecological, and economic criteria.

**Ecosystem Approach:** The plan implements ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) following NMFS's hierarchical principles, recognizing human communities as integral ecosystem components. Management acknowledges the interconnected nature of coral reef systems, emphasizing protection of habitat-forming species (corals), key ecological functions (herbivorous fish grazing), and trophic relationships throughout the marine food web.

**Data-Limited Management:** Given insufficient data for traditional stock assessments, the plan employs a four-tier Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) Control Rule system. Most stocks fall under Tier 4, using Sustainable Yield Levels (SYL) based on historical landings (2000-2010 reference period), life history characteristics, and vulnerability assessments combining productivity and susceptibility scoring.

**Regulatory Framework:** Management measures include Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) ranging from zero (prohibited species like Nassau grouper, goliath grouper, and queen conch) to over 200,000 pounds for heavily harvested species. Accountability measures trigger management responses when ACLs are exceeded. The plan incorporates existing regulations while establishing new island-specific measures including seasonal spawning closures, size limits, gear restrictions, and spatial protections like the Hind Bank Marine Conservation District.

**Economic and Social Context:** The fishery supports approximately 119 licensed commercial fishermen operating small-scale vessels averaging 24.6 feet, utilizing diverse gear (lines 77.8%, traps 43.4%, nets 26.3%). The sector provides both commercial income and cultural subsistence needs, particularly important given regional unemployment rates exceeding 12%. Hurricane impacts in 2017 caused an estimated $3.6 million in commercial fishing losses, highlighting the vulnerability of these communities.

**Essential Fish Habitat:** The plan designates EFH from mean high water to the EEZ boundary across diverse habitats including coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves, hard bottom, and pelagic environments. Habitat Areas of Particular Concern protect critical spawning and nursery areas.

**Implementation Framework:** The plan establishes standard and abbreviated framework procedures enabling efficient management adjustments without full amendments. This adaptive management approach allows responses to new scientific information, changing environmental conditions, and emerging conservation needs.

The plan represents a model for data-limited fisheries management in tropical systems, balancing conservation requirements with socioeconomic needs of fishing communities while protecting essential ecosystem functions and biodiversity.

## Ecosystem Policies, Goals, and Objectives

### **Ecosystem Policies**
- **Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management (EBFM):** Implementation following NMFS's hierarchical six-principle approach recognizing physical, biological, economic, and social interactions
- **Human Community Integration:** Recognition of fishing communities as integral ecosystem components requiring protection alongside marine resources
- **Island-Based Management:** Transition from regional to localized management acknowledging unique biological, ecological, economic, and cultural characteristics
- **Precautionary Approach:** Conservative management for data-limited stocks using vulnerability assessments and buffer reductions

### **Goals**
- **G1:** Prevent overfishing while achieving optimum yield from each federally managed fishery
- **G2:** Maintain long-term sustainable use of coral reef fishery resources while preventing adverse ecosystem impacts  
- **G3:** Ensure continued health of fishery resources for sustained participation of fishing communities
- **G4:** Manage fisheries within ecosystem production limits to maintain ecosystem goods and services
- **G5:** Account for biological, social, and economic differences among islands and communities
- **G6:** Foster collaboration between territorial and federal authorities for compatible management
