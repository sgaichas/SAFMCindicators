# SUMMARY OF PACIFIC PELAGIC FISHERY ECOSYSTEM PLAN

This Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP) for Pacific Pelagic Fisheries represents the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council's transition from species-based fishery management plans to place-based ecosystem management. The plan encompasses waters where domestic vessels fish for pelagic species within the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) of American Samoa, CNMI, Guam, Hawaii, and Pacific Remote Island Areas.

The FEP manages highly migratory pelagic species including tunas (bigeye, yellowfin, albacore, skipjack), billfish (swordfish, marlin, spearfish, sailfish), sharks, and other species like mahimahi and wahoo. These species are caught primarily by longline, troll, handline, pole-and-line, and purse seine gear.

Key fisheries include the Hawaii-based longline fleet (164 permitted vessels), American Samoa longline fleet targeting albacore for canneries, and various small-boat troll and handline operations throughout the region. The Hawaii longline fishery is the largest component, landing approximately 19.3 million pounds annually with an ex-vessel value of nearly $58 million.

The plan adopts an ecosystem-based approach while maintaining existing management measures from the previous Pelagic FMP. It establishes Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) from surface waters to 1,000 meters depth, with Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPC) designated over seamounts and banks.

International coordination is critical given the highly migratory nature of these species. The U.S. participates in Regional Fishery Management Organizations (RFMOs) including the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) and Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), which set catch limits for bigeye and yellowfin tuna.

Current management challenges include addressing overfishing of Pacific-wide bigeye tuna and interactions with protected species like sea turtles and seabirds. Various mitigation measures have been implemented including circle hooks, turtle release equipment, and seabird avoidance techniques.

The FEP establishes an advisory structure with Plan Teams, Advisory Panels, and Scientific and Statistical Committee to provide ongoing ecosystem-based management guidance. It emphasizes adaptive management, community participation, and integration of traditional indigenous knowledge.
