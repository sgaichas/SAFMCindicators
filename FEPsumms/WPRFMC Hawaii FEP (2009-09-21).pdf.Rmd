# Summary

The Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP) for the Hawaii Archipelago represents a landmark shift from species-based to place-based fisheries management by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (WPRFMC). This 266-page document consolidates four existing Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) - Bottomfish and Seamount Groundfish, Crustaceans, Precious Corals, and Coral Reef Ecosystems - into a single ecosystem-based approach for federal waters around the Hawaii Archipelago.

The FEP establishes a comprehensive framework for managing marine resources that incorporates ecosystem science and principles while addressing both ecological and cultural needs. Rather than implementing new regulations, it maintains existing measures but reorganizes them under a place-based structure that includes management unit species such as deep-water snappers, spiny lobsters, precious corals, and coral reef-associated species.

Key management areas include the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) and Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), though the NWHI commercial fisheries face significant changes due to the 2006 establishment of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. The monument immediately closed commercial crustacean fishing and mandated closure of bottomfish fisheries by June 2011.

The FEP emphasizes community participation, particularly indigenous Hawaiian involvement through initiatives like the Hoohanohano I Na Kupuna conference series, which seeks to integrate traditional ahupua'a management practices into contemporary resource management. This approach recognizes that effective ecosystem management requires both scientific knowledge and traditional ecological knowledge from local communities.

Management challenges include addressing overfishing in MHI bottomfish stocks (determined in 2005), implementing total allowable catch limits, and establishing federal permits and reporting requirements for non-commercial fisheries. The plan also addresses essential fish habitat designations, protected species interactions, and habitat conservation measures.

The FEP establishes advisory structures including place-based Advisory Panels, Plan Teams, and Regional Ecosystem Advisory Committees to ensure ongoing stakeholder participation and scientific oversight. International coordination occurs through organizations like the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission.

Environmental considerations include designation of Essential Fish Habitat and Habitat Areas of Particular Concern, assessment of fishing and non-fishing impacts, and development of mitigation measures for activities affecting marine ecosystems. The plan emphasizes adaptive management approaches that can respond to new scientific information and changing conditions while maintaining the long-term sustainability of marine resources and the communities that depend on them.
