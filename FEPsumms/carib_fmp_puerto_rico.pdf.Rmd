# Comprehensive Summary of Puerto Rico Fishery Ecosystem Plan

## Executive Summary (500 words)

The Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and Environmental Assessment represents a transformative shift from Caribbean-wide to island-based fisheries management, establishing a comprehensive framework for federal waters (9-200 nautical miles) surrounding Puerto Rico. This plan consolidates and replaces four existing Caribbean FMPs (Reef Fish, Spiny Lobster, Queen Conch, and Coral) with a tailored approach that recognizes Puerto Rico's unique biological, ecological, economic, and cultural characteristics.

The plan implements seven key actions: establishing island-based management structure, revising species lists to focus on locally relevant stocks, organizing species into management complexes with indicator species, establishing maximum sustainable yield proxies and reference points, creating accountability measures for catch limit overages, identifying essential fish habitat for newly managed species, and establishing framework procedures for adaptive management adjustments.

Management covers 68 marine species/stock complexes organized into three main groups: Puerto Rico Reef Fish (including snappers, groupers, parrotfish, and other reef-associated species), Puerto Rico Pelagics (tunas, dolphinfish, mackerels, and other open-water species new to federal management), and Puerto Rico Rays. The approach utilizes a tiered ABC (Acceptable Biological Catch) control rule system responding to data availability, with most stocks managed under Tier 4 (data-limited) using Sustainable Yield Level calculations based on historical landings and vulnerability assessments.

The biological environment encompasses diverse marine habitats from shallow coral reefs to deep oceanic waters, supporting numerous protected species including sea turtles, marine mammals, and endangered corals. Essential Fish Habitat designations extend from coastal waters to the EEZ boundary for pelagic species and to 100 fathoms for reef-associated species, with Habitat Areas of Particular Concern protecting critical spawning aggregations and nursery areas.

The socioeconomic environment reflects Puerto Rico's unique cultural relationship with marine resources, where fishing provides economic value, cultural identity, and food security. The industry is characterized as small-scale, multi-species, and family-based, with approximately 1,074 licensed commercial fishermen operating primarily small vessels (16-30 feet) from 60+ fishing centers around the island. Recreational fishing involves 125,000-157,000 annual participants, generating $25-43 million in economic impacts.

The plan addresses significant data limitations, relying primarily on commercial landings from 1988-2016 and recreational data from 2000-2016, with substantial gaps following Hurricane Mar√≠a in 2017. Management reference points incorporate scientific uncertainty buffers (typically 50% reduction factors) and management uncertainty buffers (5-15% reductions) to account for data quality concerns.

Regional fishing patterns vary significantly, with the west coast accounting for 47% of trips and specialized deep-water snapper fisheries under limited entry permits, the south coast supporting diverse trap and diving operations, the east coast containing 46% of Puerto Rico's insular shelf, and the north coast limited by narrow shelf areas and adverse weather conditions.

The framework emphasizes adaptive management through streamlined adjustment procedures while maintaining stakeholder participation. Implementation requires coordination between federal authorities (NMFS, Coast Guard) and Puerto Rico's Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, representing a collaborative approach to sustainable marine resource management that balances conservation objectives with community needs and cultural traditions.

## Ecosystem Policies, Goals, and Objectives

### Stated Ecosystem Policy
The document establishes **Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management (EBFM)** as the overarching policy approach, following NMFS Policy 01-120. EBFM is defined as "a systematic approach to fisheries management in a geographically specified area that contributes to the resilience and sustainability of the ecosystem; recognizes the physical, biological, economic, and social interactions among the affected fishery-related components of the ecosystem, including humans; and seeks to optimize benefits among a diverse set of societal goals."

### Overall Goal
Ensure the continued health of fishery resources occurring in the EEZ surrounding Puerto Rico within the context of the unique biological, ecological, economic, and cultural characteristics of those resources and the communities dependent upon them by managing on an island basis.

1. Prevent overfishing while achieving optimum yield (OY)
2. Maintain long-term sustainable use while preventing adverse impacts

## Management Approaches

### Primary Management Approach: Island-Based Management
- **Rationale**: Transition from Caribbean-wide to island-specific management
- **Implementation**: Seven-action framework addressing species selection, stock organization, reference points, accountability measures, habitat identification, and framework procedures

### Tiered ABC Control Rule System
- **Tier 1**: Full stock assessments with biological reference points
- **Tier 2**: Age-structured models without biological reference points
- **Tier 3**: Survey-based abundance indices
- **Tier 4a**: Data-limited stocks using 75th percentile of landings
- **Tier 4b**: Data-limited stocks using mean landings

### Stock Complex Management
- **Approach**: Group similar species into complexes with indicator stocks
- **Rationale**: Enable management of data-limited species while focusing monitoring on representative species

### Sector-Based Management
- **Commercial Sector**: Trip ticket reporting, permitting requirements
- **Recreational Sector**: MRIP surveys, bag/possession limits

### Adaptive Management Framework
- **Standard Framework**: Full Council review process
- **Abbreviated Framework**: Streamlined process for minor adjustments
