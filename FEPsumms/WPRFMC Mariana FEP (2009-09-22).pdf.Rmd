# Summary of the Fishery Ecosystem Plan for the Mariana Archipelago

## Executive Summary (500 words)

This Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP) for the Mariana Archipelago represents a significant shift from species-based to place-based ecosystem management in the Western Pacific Region. Developed by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, this plan consolidates four previously separate fishery management plans (Bottomfish and Seamount Groundfish, Coral Reef Ecosystems, Crustaceans, and Precious Corals) into a comprehensive ecosystem-based approach for waters around Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI).

The FEP encompasses all waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) surrounding the 14 islands of CNMI and the Territory of Guam, covering approximately 200 nautical miles from shore. This geographic boundary reflects the interconnected nature of marine ecosystems while respecting existing jurisdictional arrangements, with local governments maintaining authority over nearshore waters (0-3 nautical miles).

The plan's foundation rests on ten overarching objectives designed to maintain biologically diverse and productive marine ecosystems while fostering sustainable resource use. These objectives emphasize science-based ecosystem approaches, adaptive management systems, public awareness, community participation, bycatch minimization, protected species and habitat management, fishing safety, compliance and enforcement, regional collaboration, and improved information systems.

Management unit species include bottomfish (15 species of snappers, groupers, jacks, and emperors), crustaceans (spiny and slipper lobsters, Kona crab, and deepwater shrimp), precious corals (pink, gold, bamboo, and black corals), and coral reef ecosystem species (over 400 currently and potentially harvested taxa including fish, invertebrates, and marine plants).

The FEP implements a precautionary, adaptive management approach that builds upon existing regulatory frameworks while establishing new institutional structures. Key management measures include federal permitting and reporting requirements for larger vessels, gear restrictions prohibiting destructive methods, area closures protecting nearshore waters from large commercial vessels, observer coverage requirements, and framework procedures for regulatory adjustments.

Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) designations protect critical areas from the shoreline to depths of 50-400 meters depending on species requirements. Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPC) provide additional protection for ecologically important, rare, or sensitive areas including coral reefs, seamount slopes, and shallow banks.

The plan establishes comprehensive advisory structures including FEP Advisory Panels, Plan Teams, Scientific and Statistical Committees, and Regional Ecosystem Advisory Committees to ensure stakeholder participation and scientific oversight. Special emphasis is placed on community-based management and indigenous participation through Community Development and Demonstration Project Programs.

Current fishery status assessments indicate no stocks are overfished or experiencing overfishing. The bottomfish fishery, primarily small-scale operations targeting shallow and deep-water complexes, maintains sustainable harvest levels. Crustacean fisheries focus mainly on nearshore hand-harvested lobsters. Coral reef fisheries support important commercial, recreational, and subsistence activities. Precious coral fisheries remain largely unexploited with exploratory quotas in place.

The FEP represents the first comprehensive ecosystem-based fisheries management plan for the region, integrating scientific knowledge with traditional practices and community needs. It provides a framework for adaptive management that can respond to new information while protecting marine ecosystems and supporting sustainable fisheries for current and future generations. The plan's success depends on continued collaboration between federal, territorial, and local agencies, along with meaningful participation from fishing communities throughout the Mariana Archipelago.
