## Aleutian Islands Fishery Ecosystem Plan Summary

The North Pacific Fishery Management Council developed the Aleutian Islands Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP) as a pilot project to apply an ecosystem approach to fishery management. The FEP covers the Aleutian Islands ecosystem from Samalga Pass (169°W) to the western boundary of the exclusive economic zone (170°E), encompassing hundreds of small volcanic islands that form a porous boundary between the Bering Sea and North Pacific.

The plan serves as an educational tool and early warning system, providing ecosystem context for fishery management decisions rather than creating new regulatory requirements. It synthesizes available information about this complex ecosystem, which is the least predictable of the ecosystems managed by the Council.

**Physical Characteristics**: The archipelago features steep rocky slopes surrounding a mostly submerged mountain range, with dramatic bathymetric changes from the 7,000+ meter deep Aleutian Trench to sea level within 150 km. Fierce tidal currents through oceanic passes create vertical mixing of water layers, affecting nutrient concentrations and creating localized prey concentrations.

**Biological Relationships**: The ecosystem supports complex food webs dominated by pelagic pathways. Key species include Atka mackerel, pollock, Pacific cod, rockfish, marine mammals (including endangered Steller sea lions), and diverse seabird populations. A 134-group food web model demonstrates interactions between species and supports analyses of shared prey relationships and ecosystem sensitivity.

**Human Dimensions**: The Aleut people inhabited the islands for 10,000 years before Russian contact in 1741 brought dramatic population declines. Today, only Atka (population 90) and Adak (population 167) remain as permanent communities within the ecosystem. In 2005, the area produced 216 million pounds of fish worth $60 million ex-vessel value, with Atka mackerel comprising 60% of volume and 23% of value.

**Management Challenges**: Multiple agencies manage different fisheries with varying spatial boundaries. The Council manages federal groundfish, while Alaska Department of Fish and Game manages crab and state fisheries, and the International Pacific Halibut Commission manages halibut.

**Risk Assessment**: The FEP employs non-quantitative risk assessment identifying 22 key ecosystem interactions across climate/physical, predator-prey, fishing effects, regulatory, and socioeconomic categories. High-priority risks include ocean acidification, total ecosystem removals from fishing, and impacts of fishery changes on community sustainability.

## Ecosystem Policies, Goals, and Objectives

### Goal:
**To provide enhanced scientific information and measurable indicators to evaluate and promote ecosystem health, sustainable fisheries, and vibrant communities in the Aleutian Islands region.**

### Key Policy Objectives:

- **Performance Metrics**: Community participation in fisheries, economic indicators
- **Ecosystem Indicators**:
  - Number of vessels and processors
  - Ex-vessel values by community
  - Employment in fishing sector
  - Community population trends

#### 6. Habitat Protection
**Objective**: Minimize fishery impacts on essential fish habitat and benthic communities
- **Management Approach**: Gear restrictions, area closures, habitat impact assessments
- **Performance Metrics**: Habitat condition assessments, recovery rates
- **Ecosystem Indicators**:
  - Coral and sponge community status
  - Benthic habitat condition
  - Kelp forest coverage
  - Seafloor impact measures

#### 7. Integrated Monitoring
**Objective**: Develop ecosystem-wide monitoring to track system status and trends
- **Management Approach**: Indicator framework, regular FEP updates, research prioritization
- **Performance Metrics**: Indicator trend analysis, data gap reduction
- **Ecosystem Indicators**:
  - Research survey indices
  - Environmental monitoring data
  - Fishery-dependent data streams
  - Community-based monitoring

The FEP emphasizes that it is a "living document" requiring regular updates and refinements, with the ultimate goal of providing the Council with better tools for ecosystem-based fishery management while supporting both ecological sustainability and human communities in the Aleutian Islands region.
