# Summary of the American Samoa Archipelago Fishery Ecosystem Plan

This 202-page Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP) for American Samoa represents the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council's transition from species-based to place-based ecosystem management. The plan covers federal waters around American Samoa and manages four fishery categories: bottomfish, crustaceans, precious corals, and coral reef ecosystems.

## Key Management Objectives and Framework

The FEP establishes 10 overarching objectives focused on maintaining biodiversity, fostering sustainable use, implementing adaptive management, promoting community participation, minimizing bycatch, managing protected species/habitats, ensuring human safety, supporting compliance/enforcement, increasing international collaboration, and improving information quality.

The document consolidates existing regulations from four separate fishery management plans into a unified, ecosystem-based approach without establishing new regulatory requirements. Instead, it creates a framework for future ecosystem-based management decisions through an adaptive, incremental approach that emphasizes community involvement and scientific uncertainty acknowledgment.

## Fisheries and Stock Status

**Bottomfish Fishery**: Small-scale operation using hook-and-line gear, primarily targeting snappers, groupers, and emperors. Recent stock assessment indicates no overfishing occurring, with MSY estimated at 74,970 pounds annually for deep-water species.

**Crustacean Fishery**: Minimal federal activity, focused primarily on spiny lobsters harvested by hand in territorial waters. No federal permits currently issued.

**Precious Coral Fishery**: No active fishery exists, though precious coral species are present. Annual quota set at 1,000 kg for exploratory harvesting.

**Coral Reef Fishery**: Requires federal special permits for potentially harvested taxa. Most activity occurs in territorial waters under local jurisdiction.

## Ecosystem Management Structure

The plan establishes comprehensive advisory structures including FEP Advisory Panels, Plan Teams, Scientific and Statistical Committees, and Regional Ecosystem Advisory Committees to ensure community participation and scientific oversight.

# Ecosystem Policies, Goals, Objectives, Management Approaches, Performance Metrics, and Indicators

## Stated Ecosystem Policies

The plan adopts eight ecosystem principles from NOAA's Ecosystem Principles Advisory Panel:
- Limited predictability of ecosystem behavior
- Recognition of real thresholds and limits
- Potential irreversibility of changes beyond thresholds
- Importance of diversity to ecosystem functioning
- Multi-scale interactions within/among ecosystems
- Interconnected ecosystem components
- Open ecosystem boundaries
- Temporal ecosystem changes

## Goals and Objectives

### Overall Goal
Establish a framework to improve realization of Magnuson-Stevens Act goals through incorporation of ecosystem science and principles.

### Ten Management Objectives

**Objective 1: Biodiversity and Sustainable Use**
- *Management Approach*: Science-based ecosystem approach emphasizing biological diversity and cultural sensitivity

**Objective 3: Public Awareness**
- *Management Approach*: Education programs to reduce unsustainable impacts and foster stewardship
- *Performance Metrics*: Outreach program reach, knowledge assessment scores
- *Indicators*: Community engagement levels, conservation behavior changes

**Objective 4: Community Participation**
- *Management Approach*: Sustained substantive involvement of local communities in resource management
- *Performance Metrics*: Community representation in advisory bodies, local knowledge incorporation
- *Indicators*: Advisory panel participation rates, community-based project numbers

**Objective 5: Bycatch Minimization**
- *Management Approach*: Gear restrictions, selective fishing practices, outreach programs
- *Performance Metrics*: Bycatch rates by fishery, mortality reduction measures
- *Indicators*: Observer data on non-target species interactions, gear modification adoption

**Objective 6: Protected Species/Habitat Management**
- *Management Approach*: Co-management of protected species, habitats, and areas through MPAs and consultations
- *Performance Metrics*: ESA consultation outcomes, MPA effectiveness measures
- *Indicators*: Protected species interaction rates, habitat condition assessments

**Objective 7: Safety at Sea**
- *Management Approach*: Promote vessel safety standards and practices
- *Performance Metrics*: Safety incident rates, training program completion
- *Indicators*: Search and rescue statistics, safety equipment compliance

**Objective 8: Compliance and Enforcement**
- *Management Approach*: Support for federal and local enforcement through coordination and capacity building
- *Performance Metrics*: Violation rates, enforcement coverage levels
- *Indicators*: Citation numbers, compliance monitoring results

**Objective 9: Regional Collaboration**
- *Management Approach*: Increased collaboration with domestic/international organizations and communities
- *Performance Metrics*: Partnership agreements, joint management initiatives
- *Indicators*: Bilateral agreement development, international forum participation

**Objective 10: Information Quality**
- *Management Approach*: Improve data quantity and quality through enhanced collection and analysis systems
- *Performance Metrics*: Data coverage improvements, assessment uncertainty reductions
- *Indicators*: Sampling effort increases, stock assessment confidence intervals

## Management Approaches by Fishery

### Bottomfish Management
- **Approach**: Multi-species stock complex management with MSY-based control rules
- **Reference Points**: FMSY, BMSY, MSST, and BFLAG specified using CPUE proxies
- **Framework**: Annual monitoring team reports with adaptive management triggers

### Precious Corals Management
- **Approach**: Precautionary quota system for exploratory harvesting
- **Restrictions**: Selective gear requirements, size limits, gold coral moratorium through 2013
- **Framework**: Annual assessments with quota adjustments based on sustainability

### Crustaceans Management
- **Approach**: Permit system with reporting requirements for EEZ fishing
- **Gear Restrictions**: Prohibition of explosives, poisons, and electrical devices
- **Framework**: Adaptive management pending fishery development

### Coral Reef Ecosystem Management
- **Approach**: Special permit system distinguishing currently versus potentially harvested taxa
- **Marine Protected Areas**: No-take zones including Rose Atoll
- **Framework**: Allowable gear list with special permit provisions for new gears

## Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) Designations

The plan designates EFH based on best available scientific information using a precautionary approach:

- **Bottomfish**: Water column and bottom habitat from shoreline to 400m depth
- **Crustaceans**: Bottom habitat to 100m for adults; water column to 150m for larvae
- **Precious Corals**: Six designated coral beds in Hawaii (none currently in American Samoa)
- **Coral Reef Species**: All waters and substrate to 50 fathoms depth

Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPC) are designated based on ecological function, sensitivity, development stress, and rarity criteria.

This comprehensive framework establishes the foundation for ecosystem-based fishery management in American Samoa while maintaining flexibility for adaptive management as scientific understanding and community needs evolve.
