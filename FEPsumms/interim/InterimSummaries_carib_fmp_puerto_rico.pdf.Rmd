# Summary of the Puerto Rico Exclusive Economic Zone Comprehensive Fishery Management Plan (500 words)

The Caribbean Fishery Management Council has developed a new Comprehensive Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Puerto Rico Exclusive Economic Zone, transitioning from a U.S. Caribbean-wide management approach to an island-based approach. This plan covers federal waters from 9-200 nautical miles from Puerto Rico's coastline and will replace four existing Caribbean-wide FMPs: Reef Fish, Spiny Lobster, Queen Conch, and Coral FMPs as they apply to Puerto Rico waters.

The plan implements seven key actions: (1) establishing the island-based FMP structure, (2) revising the species list to focus on those most relevant to Puerto Rico waters, (3) organizing stocks into management complexes with indicator species where appropriate, (4) establishing maximum sustainable yield proxies and management reference points, (5) creating accountability measures when catch limits are exceeded, (6) identifying essential fish habitat for newly managed species, and (7) establishing framework procedures for efficient management adjustments.

The transition addresses longstanding requests from Puerto Rico's fishing communities to recognize the unique biological, ecological, economic, and cultural characteristics of their fisheries. The current Caribbean-wide approach often managed species that rarely occur in Puerto Rican federal waters while excluding economically and ecologically important local species. The island-based approach allows for more targeted management that better accounts for local fishing practices, markets, gear types, and cultural preferences.

The plan reorganizes managed species into three main groups: Puerto Rico Reef Fish (including snappers, groupers, and other reef-associated species), Puerto Rico Pelagics (including tunas, dolphins, and other open-water species new to federal management), and Puerto Rico Rays (also new to federal management). Many stocks are organized into complexes with indicator species to enable more efficient management where individual species data is limited.

Management reference points are established using the Caribbean Fishery Management Council's Acceptable Biological Catch Control Rule, which incorporates scientific uncertainty and management risk tolerance. Annual catch limits and accountability measures are set for both commercial and recreational sectors, with monitoring and corrective actions if limits are exceeded.

The plan identifies essential fish habitat for newly managed species, encompassing various marine environments from coastal waters to deep ocean habitats. Framework procedures are established to allow more rapid adjustments to management measures as conditions change.

The biological environment includes diverse marine habitats from coral reefs to deep-water areas, supporting numerous protected species including sea turtles, marine mammals, and endangered corals. The socioeconomic environment reflects Puerto Rico's unique cultural relationship with marine resources, where fishing provides not just economic value but cultural identity and food security for many communities.

The plan aims to ensure long-term sustainability of Puerto Rico's marine resources while supporting the livelihoods and cultural traditions of fishing communities. It represents a significant shift toward more localized, responsive fisheries management that better reflects the specific needs and characteristics of Puerto Rico's marine environment and fishing communities.

Implementation will require coordination between federal authorities (NMFS, Coast Guard, NOAA enforcement) and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, which manages waters within 9 nautical miles of shore.

# Ecosystem Policies, Goals, and Objectives

## Stated Ecosystem Policy
The document establishes ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) as the overarching policy approach, following NMFS Policy 01-120. EBFM is defined as "a systematic approach to fisheries management in a geographically specified area that contributes to the resilience and sustainability of the ecosystem; recognizes the physical, biological, economic, and social interactions among the affected fishery-related components of the ecosystem, including humans; and seeks to optimize benefits among a diverse set of societal goals."

## Goals and Objectives

### Overall Goal (Section 1.8)
To ensure the continued health of fishery resources occurring in the EEZ surrounding Puerto Rico within the context of the unique biological, ecological, economic, and cultural characteristics of those resources and the communities dependent upon them by managing on an island basis.

### Specific Objectives:
1. Ensure productive and sustainable fisheries for the long-term livelihood, enjoyment, economy, and environment of Puerto Rico and the U.S.
2. Conserve and manage the fisheries of Puerto Rico within an island-based approach
3. Enhance stewardship among fishermen, residents, and others who value the fishery resources and the marine and coastal environments of Puerto Rico and the U.S.

## Management Approaches

### Primary Management Approach: Island-Based Management
- **Rationale**: Transition from U.S. Caribbean-wide to island-specific management to better account for local differences in environment, culture, markets, gear, and seafood preferences
- **Implementation**: Seven-action framework addressing species selection, stock organization, reference points, accountability measures, habitat identification, and framework procedures

### Stock Complex Management
- **Approach**: Group similar species into complexes with indicator stocks where individual species data is insufficient
- **Rationale**: Enable effective management of data-limited species while focusing monitoring efforts on representative species

### Adaptive Management Framework
- **Approach**: Framework procedures allowing rapid adjustment of management measures
- **Scope**: Includes adjustment of catch limits, reference points, management measures, and fishing seasons

## Performance Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics:
1. **Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)** - For data-rich stocks
2. **Sustainable Yield Level (SYL)** - For data-limited stocks using 75% of overfishing limit

The document cuts off mid-table and doesn't include the complete ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and ecosystem indicators sections that you specifically asked me to analyze.

From the partial content provided, here's what I can summarize:

## Brief Summary of Available Content

This document describes Puerto Rico's Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and Environmental Assessment, which transitions from a U.S. Caribbean-wide management approach to an island-based approach specifically for Puerto Rico's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). 

The document defines "ecosystem" in the NMFS context as a geographically specified system including fishery resources, participants, environment, and environmental processes, with fishers and fishing communities explicitly included.

The plan addresses required provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, particularly the implementation of Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) and Accountability Measures (AMs) following 2007 revisions to the Act.

**Key Goals Listed (7 total):**
1. Prevent overfishing while achieving optimum yield (OY)
2. Maintain long-term sustainable use while preventing adverse impacts
3. Ensure continued health of fishery resources for sustained community participation
4. Manage fisheries within ecosystem production limits
5. Account for biological, social, cultural, and economic differences
6. Foster collaboration between territorial and federal authorities
7. Ensure effective outreach and enforcement

**Objectives (19 total identified):**
The document lists 19 specific objectives covering sustainable use, bycatch reduction, data collection, international cooperation, spatial planning, equitable resource use, permitting, management flexibility, enforcement, public awareness, socio-economic health, spawning aggregation protection, essential fish habitat (EFH) protection, habitat management, ecosystem services, ecological relationships, new fishery development, and underutilized resource development.

**Actions Described:**
- Action 1: Transition to island-based management
- Action 2: Identify stocks needing federal management (using 5 criteria A-E)
- Action 3: Compose stock complexes and identify indicator stocks

**To provide the complete analysis you requested**, I would need:
1. The complete document, particularly sections on ecosystem indicators
2. Performance metrics sections
3. Management approaches for each objective
4. The specific ecosystem resistance and recovery section you mentioned

Could you please provide the complete document or the missing sections?

I'm unable to provide the requested summary because the document you've shared only contains species tables and organizational charts for fish stock complexes, rather than the complete fishery ecosystem plan. The text shows Chapter 2 (Actions and Alternatives) focusing on how fish species are grouped into stock complexes for management purposes.

## Summary of the Provided Section (species groupings):

The section details how fish species are organized into stock/stock complexes under Puerto Rico's Fishery Management Plan (FMP). It presents three alternatives:

- **Alternative 1**: Continue previous management groupings from Caribbean-wide FMPs
- **Alternative 2**: Manage each species individually  
- **Preferred Alternative 3**: Use flexible approach combining individual stocks and complexes based on scientific data

The document describes groupings for major fish families including:
- Snappers (6 complexes/stocks)
- Groupers (6 complexes/stocks) 
- Parrotfish (2 complexes)
- Surgeonfish, Triggerfish, Wrasses, Angelfish (various complexes)
- Pelagic species like tunas, mackerels, dolphinfish
- Rays, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, and corals

Species are grouped based on biological similarities, fishing patterns, habitat co-occurrence, and vulnerability assessments using Productivity-Susceptibility Analysis (PSA).

## Missing Information:

5. Policy statements

Could you please share the complete fishery ecosystem plan document or the specific sections containing the ecosystem management framework, goals, and indicators?

I cannot complete this summary as the document appears to be cut off and incomplete. The text ends mid-sentence while discussing Great barracuda values in Table 2.5.2. 

However, I can provide a partial summary of what is available:

## Summary (Based on Available Text - Incomplete)

This document is a Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP) or Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Puerto Rico's federal waters. The document focuses on establishing management frameworks for various fish stocks and stock complexes in Puerto Rico's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

**Key Actions Discussed:**

1. **Action 4 - Status Determination Criteria and Management Reference Points**: Establishes criteria for determining if stocks are overfished or undergoing overfishing, including Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), Maximum Fishing Mortality Threshold (MFMT), Overfishing Limit (OFL), and Minimum Stock Size Threshold (MSST).

2. **Action 5 - Accountability Measures**: Establishes measures to prevent Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) from being exceeded and corrective actions when overages occur.

**Management Approach**: The plan uses a tiered approach (Tiers 1-4) based on data availability, with Tier 4 being most applicable for data-limited Caribbean stocks. It introduces the concept of Sustainable Yield Level (SYL) for data-poor situations.

**Stock Organization**: The plan addresses both traditional reef fish species and newly managed pelagic species including dolphinfish, wahoo, mackerel, tunas, barracuda, and tripletail.

## Incomplete Analysis
Unfortunately, I cannot provide the complete analysis of ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and ecosystem indicators as requested because:

1. The document is incomplete/cut off
2. The specific ecosystem policies and goals section may not have been included in the provided text
3. The performance metrics and ecosystem indicators sections are not visible in the available content

To complete this analysis, I would need the full document, particularly sections that detail the ecosystem approach, environmental objectives, and monitoring frameworks.

I cannot provide a complete 500-word summary of this fishery ecosystem plan as the text you've provided appears to be fragments from different sections of a document focused on accountability measures (AMs) and framework procedures rather than a comprehensive fishery ecosystem plan. The content is primarily from Chapter 2 (Actions and Alternatives) of what appears to be a Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan/Environmental Assessment, specifically covering Actions 5-7.

## Summary of Available Content (based on provided excerpts):

The document discusses the Puerto Rico FMP development following a transition from Caribbean-wide to island-based fisheries management. Key components include:

**Accountability Measures (Action 5):** The plan establishes various alternatives for accountability measures when Annual Catch Limits (ACL) are exceeded. Preferred Alternative 2 uses a stepwise temporal approach comparing average landings against ACLs, while Alternative 3 establishes Annual Catch Targets (ACTs) as triggers. Alternative 5 applies harvest prohibitions for stocks with zero ACLs, including queen conch, Nassau grouper, goliath grouper, blue and rainbow parrotfish, giant manta ray, spotted eagle ray, southern stingray, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, and managed corals.

**Essential Fish Habitat (Action 6):** The plan identifies EFH for 18 finfish species new to federal management, including cubera snapper, yellowmouth grouper, various tunas, mackerels, rays, and dolphinfish. EFH designations are based on functional relationships between life history stages and marine habitats, extending from mean high/low water to the EEZ boundary for various substrate types including coral reefs, hard bottom, seagrass, mangroves, and pelagic waters.

**Framework Procedures (Action 7):** Establishes streamlined processes for future management adjustments through open and closed framework procedures, including abbreviated frameworks for routine changes and standard frameworks for more substantial modifications.

## Missing Information:

I cannot identify the stated ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, or specific ecosystem indicators as this information is not included in the provided text fragments. The document appears to focus on specific management actions rather than overarching ecosystem management principles.

## Regarding the Specific Section:

The numerical data you referenced (693, 150,924, etc. for Tripletail: 39,005, 35,104, etc.) appears to be catch limit data, but without additional context or complete sentences, I cannot provide a meaningful summary of that specific section.

To provide the complete analysis you've requested, I would need access to the full document, particularly sections covering ecosystem-based management goals, objectives, and indicators.

## Summary of Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan (500 words)

The Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan (FMP) represents a significant transition from species-based to island-based fisheries management in the U.S. Caribbean. This plan consolidates and updates management measures previously scattered across four separate FMPs (Reef Fish, Spiny Lobster, Queen Conch, and Coral) while adding new species to the management unit.

The document encompasses seven major actions addressing critical management needs. Action 1 establishes a comprehensive management unit of 37 stocks/stock complexes, including retained species from previous FMPs and 13 stocks new to federal management. Action 2 creates new stock complex configurations to improve data collection and management efficiency, grouping species with similar ecological characteristics, fishing methods, and market values. Action 3 introduces reference points and stock status criteria for newly managed stocks, while Actions 4 and 5 establish Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) and Accountability Measures (AMs) to prevent overfishing and ensure sustainable harvests.

Action 6 designates Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for new species, extending from mean high water to the EEZ boundary for pelagic species and eggs/larvae, and to 100 fathoms for reef-associated species. Action 7 implements framework procedures enabling more responsive management adjustments while maintaining public participation opportunities.

The plan addresses Puerto Rico's unique marine environment, characterized by diverse habitats including coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves, and deep-water systems. The island's steep continental shelves create distinct fishing zones, with most activity occurring within 100 fathoms where the majority of fishable habitat exists. The biological environment supports hundreds of marine species, with managed stocks representing those requiring conservation priority.

Significantly, the document addresses the devastating impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, which fundamentally altered both the marine ecosystem and socioeconomic conditions. These storms caused unprecedented damage to coastal habitats, fishing infrastructure, and island-wide economic systems, necessitating adaptive management approaches.

The preferred management alternatives balance conservation objectives with socioeconomic realities. Alternative 2 is selected for most actions, providing moderate restrictions while maintaining fishing opportunities. The framework procedures under Preferred Alternative 2 offer flexibility through both abbreviated and standard processes, ensuring adequate public review while enabling timely management responses.

The plan incorporates extensive Essential Fish Habitat protections, including Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPCs) at spawning aggregation sites and ecologically critical areas. These designations protect important nursery grounds, coral reefs, and seagrass beds essential for managed species' life cycles.

Economic analysis indicates that while the plan represents administrative changes rather than direct economic impacts, the improved management structure could provide long-term benefits through enhanced stock protection and rebuilding potential. The framework procedures may reduce implementation time for necessary management adjustments.

Social considerations emphasize maintaining fishing opportunities while ensuring sustainable harvests. The island-based approach better reflects local fishing practices and ecological connections, potentially improving compliance and management effectiveness.

This comprehensive plan establishes a foundation for sustainable fisheries management in Puerto Rico's EEZ, addressing both immediate conservation needs and long-term ecosystem resilience in the face of environmental and economic challenges.

## Ecosystem Policies, Goals, and Objectives

The document does not contain a dedicated section outlining formal ecosystem policies, goals, and objectives with corresponding management approaches, performance metrics, and ecosystem indicators. While the FMP incorporates ecosystem considerations throughout (such as EFH designations, habitat protections, and species interactions), it does not present a structured ecosystem management framework with specific measurable objectives and indicators.

The document mentions ongoing development of a separate Fishery Ecosystem Plan for the U.S. Caribbean but does not detail its contents in this FMP.

## Framework Procedures Section Summary

**Preferred Alternative 2** establishes framework procedures allowing implementation of specific management measures through streamlined processes while maintaining public participation. The framework includes:

**Allowed Actions:**
- Modifications to stock status determination criteria, optimum yield, and maximum sustainable yield
- Adjustments to Annual Catch Limits and Accountability Measures  
- Changes to fishing year definitions
- Essential Fish Habitat modifications
- Gear restrictions and fishing area modifications
- Data collection requirement changes
- Permit and reporting requirement adjustments

**Required Procedures:**
- **Standard Framework**: Full Council review with Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) evaluation, Advisory Panel (AP) input, and public hearings across multiple Council meetings
- **Abbreviated Framework**: Streamlined process for minor technical adjustments with reduced meeting requirements but maintained public notification

**Comparative Analysis:**
- **Alternative 1** (No Action): Retains existing limited framework options, potentially inadequate for Puerto Rico-specific needs
- **Preferred Alternative 2**: Provides balanced approach with both standard and abbreviated options, ensuring adequate public review while enabling responsive management
- **Alternative 3**: Offers broader framework scope but with reduced public input requirements under certain procedures  
- **Alternative 4**: Requires most extensive public input with three Council meetings, potentially creating unnecessary delays for urgent management needs

**Benefits of Preferred Alternative 2:**
- Maintains sufficient public review and involvement
- Accommodates streamlined implementation when appropriate
- Provides flexibility through dual framework options
- Better balances efficiency with transparency compared to other alternatives

The framework procedures represent administrative changes without direct economic impacts, though they may provide indirect benefits through improved stock protection and more timely management responses.

I cannot provide a summary of this fishery ecosystem plan as this appears to be only a section of a larger document (pages 169-199 of Chapter 3), not the complete plan. This section specifically covers the socioeconomic environment of Puerto Rico, focusing on:

**Recommendation:**
To provide the comprehensive analysis you're seeking, I would need access to the complete fishery ecosystem plan document, particularly the sections that outline the management framework, objectives, and performance measures.

If you can provide the complete document or the specific sections containing the management framework and objectives, I'd be happy to provide the detailed summary and analysis you requested.

I'll provide a comprehensive summary of this Puerto Rico fishery ecosystem plan document, followed by detailed listings of the policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and ecosystem indicators.

## Summary (500 words)

This Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and Environmental Assessment document presents a comprehensive framework for managing fisheries in Puerto Rico's federal waters. The plan covers diverse marine ecosystems surrounding Puerto Rico, including coral reefs, deep-water habitats, and pelagic environments that support numerous commercially and recreationally important species.

The document describes the complex physical and biological environment of Puerto Rico's waters, spanning from shallow coral reef systems to deep oceanic environments. The marine ecosystem includes essential fish habitats, spawning aggregation sites, and migration corridors critical for species like snappers, groupers, parrotfish, angelfish, surgeonfish, and various pelagic species including dolphinfish, wahoo, and barracuda.

Puerto Rico's fishing industry is characterized as small-scale, multi-species, and family-based. Commercial fishermen use diverse gear types including lines, traps, nets, and SCUBA diving, targeting reef fish, coastal pelagics, and shellfish. The fleet consists primarily of small vessels (16-30 feet) operating from 60+ fishing centers (villas pesqueras) around the island. West coast fishermen account for the largest share of fishing activity, representing 47% of trips and 39% of landings by weight historically.

The document highlights significant regional variations in fishing patterns. The west coast features a specialized deep-water snapper fishery with limited entry permits for 45 dedicated fishermen. The south coast, with its larger insular shelf and more protected waters, supports diverse fisheries including important spiny lobster and queen conch operations. The east coast has the largest shelf area (46% of Puerto Rico's insular shelf) and supports productive multi-species fisheries. The north coast is most limited by narrow shelf areas and adverse weather conditions.

Recreational fishing is culturally and economically significant, with approximately 125,000-157,000 annual participants. Tournament fishing for billfish and pelagics generates substantial economic impacts estimated at $25-43 million annually. The recreational sector targets many of the same species as commercial fishermen, with dolphinfish being the most commonly caught species in recent years.

The fisheries support approximately 1,074 licensed commercial fishermen, though not all are active annually. About 74% fish full-time, with 61% deriving 75-100% of household income from fishing. The industry generates modest economic impacts, with 2015 ex-vessel revenues of $6.13 million representing 0.01% of Puerto Rico's GDP.

Socially and culturally, fishing communities are embedded in Puerto Rico's coastal municipalities, with fishing being a family-based enterprise involving multiple generations. The villas pesqueras system provides critical infrastructure for vessel docking, equipment storage, and catch marketing while serving as community gathering places for fishermen.

The document emphasizes the interconnected nature of commercial, recreational, and subsistence fishing, noting that approximately 25% of commercial catch is retained for household consumption and community sharing. This reflects fishing's role beyond mere economic activity, serving important food security and cultural functions.

Environmental challenges include habitat degradation, coastal development, pollution, and climate change impacts. The plan addresses these through ecosystem-based management approaches that consider the complex interactions between fishing activities and marine ecosystem health.

## Section Summary: Puerto Rico Coastal Fisheries by Region

This section details the specialized queen and cardinal snapper fishery along Puerto Rico's west coast, which historically involves a small number of dedicated fishermen targeting patchy deep-water habitats under dynamic oceanographic conditions. Only dedicated commercial fishermen maintain long-term participation due to the specialized nature of this fishery. A special limited entry permit system implemented in 2013 restricts access to 45 qualified fishermen who demonstrated historical participation, limiting them to 120 trips annually.

**West Coast**: Accounts for 45-47% of annual fishing trips and 39% of historical landings (1988-2016), making it the most productive region.

**South Coast (Lajas to Guayama)**: Features varied habitats supporting snappers, groupers, mackerels, tunas, and barracuda. The larger insular shelf (1.85 times larger than north coast) and less abrupt drop-off provide better conditions for traps, nets, and SCUBA operations. Primary gear includes SCUBA diving, fish traps, bottom lines, and nets. Important species include spiny lobster, queen conch, yellowtail/mutton/lane snappers, and octopus. Represents 28% of total landings but has declined recently from 24% to 19% (2014-2016).

**East Coast**: Contains the largest insular shelf (46% of Puerto Rico's total) with depths less than 240 feet throughout. Features productive fishing grounds between Fajardo-Ceiba and islands of Culebra/Vieques. Supports 20% of total landings, increasing from 26% to 34% (2014-2016). Targets reef fish (yellowtail, lane, mutton snappers), deep-water snappers, coastal pelagics, spiny lobster, and queen conch.

**North Coast**: Most limited by narrow continental shelf with 100-fathom curve 1-2 miles offshore and proximity to 28,000-foot deep Puerto Rico trench. Adverse weather and high wave action limit fishing to 6 months annually. Represents only 14% of total landings. Fishermen favor hook and line methods, targeting yellowtail snapper, triggerfish, parrotfish, deep-water snappers, and pelagics like dolphinfish and king mackerel.

Regional conflicts exist, particularly in La Parguera where commercial fishermen compete with increasing numbers of recreational fishermen for the same species, especially dolphinfish, leading to significant tensions exacerbated by declining landings since 2001.

## Ecosystem Policies, Goals, Objectives, Management Approaches, Performance Metrics, and Ecosystem Indicators

**Note**: After carefully reviewing the document section provided, I must note that this appears to be Chapter 3 (Affected Environment) of the Puerto Rico FMP, which focuses on describing the current environmental, biological, social, and economic conditions. The actual ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and specific ecosystem indicators would typically be found in other chapters of the FMP (likely Chapters 1 and 2 for management measures, and potentially Chapter 4 for environmental consequences).

The section provided does not explicitly state formal ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, or specific ecosystem indicators as these are typically management framework elements rather than environmental baseline descriptions.

However, the document does reference:

**Implicit Management Approaches Mentioned:**
- Limited entry permit system for deep-water snappers (queen and cardinal snapper)
- Trip limits (120 trips annually for permitted deep-water snapper fishermen)
- Gear restrictions and spatial management through state/federal water boundaries
- Licensing requirements for commercial fishermen
- Special permits for specific species (spiny lobster, queen conch, land crabs, etc.)

**Monitoring Elements Referenced:**
- Monthly catch reporting requirements for commercial fishermen
- MRIP recreational fishing surveys
- Commercial landings data collection
- Fishermen census data (conducted in 2002 and 2008)
- Tournament catch monitoring
- Vessel registration and permitting systems

**Environmental Indicators Mentioned:**
- Species composition and abundance
- Habitat condition assessments
- Water quality parameters
- Coastal development impacts
- Climate change effects

To provide the complete requested analysis of ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and specific ecosystem indicators, I would need access to the complete FMP document, particularly the management framework and implementation chapters.

I cannot see the full document content, but I can provide a summary based on the visible sections and then address the specific section you've highlighted.

## Summary of Puerto Rico Fishery Ecosystem Plan (Based on visible sections)

This document presents a Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and Environmental Assessment that transitions from a U.S. Caribbean-wide management approach to an island-based approach. The plan addresses federal fishery management in Puerto Rico's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

**Key Actions:**
1. **Management Transition**: Establish a new Puerto Rico FMP to replace the four existing Caribbean-wide FMPs (Reef Fish, Spiny Lobster, Queen Conch, and Coral)
2. **Species Selection**: Use a stepwise criteria process to identify 63 fish species, queen conch, spiny lobster, and all coral/sea cucumber/sea urchin species for management
3. **Stock Organization**: Manage species as individual stocks or stock complexes based on scientific analysis

**Environmental Consequences Analysis:**
- **Physical Environment**: Minimal direct effects expected; indirect benefits possible through enhanced management
- **Biological/Ecological**: Positive long-term effects expected through more tailored, comprehensive ecosystem management
- **Economic**: No direct effects; potential indirect benefits through enhanced compliance and island-specific management
- **Social**: Positive effects expected from more responsive, locally-relevant management addressing community concerns

## Summary of Highlighted Section

This section describes the economic and cultural importance of shellfish (particularly lobster and conch) and finfish in Puerto Rico's fisheries:

**Key Points:**
- **Tourist Demand**: Lobster and conch are highly valued by tourists and increasingly consumed by locals
- **Market Dominance**: By 2012, conch represented >50% of shellfish landings and value; by 2016, lobster led in both volume and value
- **Cultural Significance**: Species like king mackerel hold important cultural value, served at festivals and recognized by commercial fishermen
- **Import Dependence**: 75% of seafood consumed in Puerto Rico comes from imports (mostly frozen, salted, or canned), often cheaper than local fresh products
- **Historical Context**: Imported seafood has deep cultural roots dating to Spanish colonization (salted cod, sardines, mackerel)
- **Restaurant Industry**: During tourist seasons, restaurants typically use imported seafood to meet demand at reduced costs

**Recreational Fishing & Tourism:**
- Strong connection between recreational fishing and tourism industry
- Coastal activities (fishing, diving, snorkeling, boating) attract both visitors and residents
- Growing emphasis on "island experience" and eco-tourism
- Tourism contributed $3.2 billion to Puerto Rico's economy in 2012

The section demonstrates the complex interplay between local fishing traditions, tourism demands, import competition, and cultural food preferences that shape Puerto Rico's marine fisheries landscape.

Unfortunately, I don't see the ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and specific ecosystem indicators you requested, as that information appears to be in sections not visible in the provided text. If you could share those specific sections, I'd be happy to list them systematically.

# Summary of Puerto Rico Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FMP)

## Executive Summary (500 words)

The Puerto Rico Fishery Ecosystem Plan represents a significant transition from region-wide Caribbean fishery management to island-specific management. This comprehensive plan addresses the management of 68 marine species/stock complexes in Puerto Rico's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), including both previously managed species from existing Caribbean FMPs (Reef Fish, Spiny Lobster, Queen Conch, and Coral) and 18 newly added finfish species.

The FMP establishes a science-based management framework utilizing a tiered ABC (Acceptable Biological Catch) control rule that accounts for data availability and scientific uncertainty. For stocks with limited data (Tier 4), the plan employs Sustainable Yield Level (SYL) calculations based on historical landings and life history characteristics. The management approach recognizes the multispecies nature of Caribbean fisheries and the jointness in catch that makes individual species management challenging.

Key management features include sector-specific management (commercial and recreational) where data permit, stock complex organization based on scientific and stakeholder input, and establishment of Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) with corresponding Accountability Measures (AMs). The plan implements different AM approaches based on species characteristics: post-season AMs for reef fish and spiny lobster, Annual Catch Targets (ACTs) for pelagic species, and harvest prohibitions serving as AMs for overfished or ecologically critical species.

Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) designations are extended to newly managed species, with some areas receiving expanded depth ranges to the EEZ boundary. The plan emphasizes ecosystem considerations, particularly for herbivorous species like parrotfish that provide critical grazing services to coral reef ecosystems.

A significant challenge addressed is data limitations, with the plan relying on commercial landings data primarily from the 1980s-2016 period, with recreational data available from 2000-2016. The framework anticipates improving data collection and allows for adaptive management as better information becomes available.

The FMP reflects extensive stakeholder engagement through District Advisory Panels and incorporates local fishing practices and ecological knowledge. It balances conservation objectives with socioeconomic considerations, recognizing fishing's cultural and economic importance to Puerto Rican communities.

Environmental consequences analysis indicates generally positive biological and ecological effects from establishing science-based catch limits and accountability measures. However, some management actions may create short-term social and economic challenges, particularly for species receiving reduced catch limits or harvest prohibitions. The plan addresses these concerns through careful stock complex organization and buffer applications that consider ecosystem services and uncertainty levels.

## Ecosystem Policies, Goals, and Objectives

The document does not explicitly state comprehensive ecosystem policies, goals, and objectives in a dedicated section. The management approach is primarily focused on single-species and stock complex management within an ecosystem context rather than comprehensive ecosystem-based management.

## Management Approaches, Performance Metrics, and Ecosystem Indicators

The document primarily focuses on species-specific management rather than comprehensive ecosystem indicators. However, some ecosystem considerations are mentioned:

**Management Approaches:**
- Tiered ABC control rule (Tiers 1-4b)
- Stock complex management for related species
- Sector-based management (commercial/recreational)
- Adaptive management framework

**Performance Metrics:**
- Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) compliance
- Accountability Measures trigger rates
- Stock status relative to reference points (MSY, OFL, ABC)

**Ecosystem Indicators (Limited):**
- Herbivore grazing capacity (parrotfish, surgeonfish contribution to coral reef health)
- Trophic interactions maintenance
- Habitat protection through EFH designations

## Summary of Specified Document Section

The summarized section discusses the challenges and negative consequences of managing species individually in multispecies fisheries. The text explains that individual management becomes problematic when reliable data are unavailable, potentially leading to overly precautionary reference points that trigger frequent closures and disrupt fishing patterns. This is particularly concerning given the "jointness in catch" - fishermen's inability to selectively target species in multispecies fisheries.

The section contrasts different management alternatives, noting that Alternative 1 and Preferred Alternative 3 both utilize stock complexes but that Alternative 3 benefits from recent expert review and stakeholder input, making it more suitable for Puerto Rico-specific management. Alternative 4 introduces indicator stock approaches where appropriate, allowing complex-wide management based on representative species when sufficient data exists.

The discussion emphasizes that these management decisions create both direct administrative burdens (updating regulations, monitoring ACLs) and indirect social effects. Individual stock management requires more administrative resources and may trigger unnecessary management actions that negatively impact fishing communities, especially when data limitations force precautionary approaches that result in frequent closures. The preferred alternatives aim to balance scientific rigor with practical management considerations and stakeholder acceptance.

I can only see a partial excerpt from pages 297-301 of what appears to be a much larger fishery ecosystem plan document. This excerpt specifically covers Chapter 4 "Environmental Consequences" and discusses the effects of EFH (Essential Fish Habitat) identification alternatives on different environments.

## Summary of the Section (Pages 297-301)

This section evaluates three alternatives for identifying Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for species newly added to federal management in Puerto Rico waters:

- **Alternative 1 (No Action)**: Would not identify EFH for new species
- **Alternative 2 (Preferred)**: Uses available information to describe and identify EFH, including deeper water substrates beyond 100 fathoms  
- **Alternative 3**: Would allow selection among various methods to determine EFH based on data availability

### Key Environmental Effects Analysis:

**Physical Environment**: EFH identification itself has no direct physical effects, but could lead to protective measures that benefit habitat. The preferred alternative extends EFH designation to deeper waters but is not expected to require additional management actions due to existing harvest prohibitions and the pelagic nature of deep-water fisheries.

**Biological/Ecological Environment**: No direct effects, but could lead to beneficial habitat protections. The preferred alternative would comply with Magnuson-Stevens Act requirements and could trigger consultations on federal actions affecting EFH.

**Economic Environment**: Administrative action with no direct economic effects. Potential long-term benefits if EFH protections prevent habitat degradation and maintain fish productivity. However, specific economic impacts cannot be determined without knowing what protective regulations might be implemented.

**Social Environment**: Limited direct social impacts, but positive indirect effects from habitat protection that ensures healthy fish stocks for harvest and non-consumptive uses.

**Administrative Environment**: The preferred alternative complies with federal requirements and uses established approaches, minimizing additional administrative burden.

## Ecosystem Policies, Goals, and Objectives

I cannot provide the requested comprehensive list of ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and ecosystem indicators because this information is not contained in the partial excerpt provided (pages 297-301). This section only covers environmental consequences analysis for EFH identification alternatives. To provide the requested information, I would need access to earlier sections of the document that establish the overarching ecosystem framework, management objectives, and monitoring indicators for the fishery ecosystem plan.

I need the full document to provide a complete 500-word summary and extract all the requested information. However, I can see this is Section 5.6.2 regarding bag and possession limits for Puerto Rico reef fish. Here's what I can provide from the visible content:

## Summary of Visible Section (Bag and Possession Limits)

This section outlines bag and possession limits for recreational harvest in Puerto Rico waters. For reef fish, there are aggregate bag limits for two main groups:

1. **Snapper, grouper, and parrotfish combined**: 5 fish per person/day (maximum 2 parrotfish), or if 3+ persons aboard, 15 fish total per vessel/day (maximum 6 parrotfish)

2. **Angelfish, grunts, wrasses, jacks, triggerfish, and surgeonfish combined**: 5 fish per person/day (maximum 1 surgeonfish), or if 3+ persons aboard, 15 fish total per vessel/day (maximum 4 surgeonfish)

For **Caribbean Spiny Lobster**: 3 spiny lobsters per person/day, not to exceed 10 per vessel/day.

The document also includes restrictions on sale/purchase, with prohibitions on selling live red hind or mutton snapper for marine aquarium trade, and detailed import restrictions for Caribbean spiny lobster with specific minimum tail weights (6-ounce for Puerto Rico, 5-ounce for other US jurisdictions).

## Ecosystem Information Extracted

From the visible portions, I can identify these management elements:

**Management Approaches:**
- Bag and possession limits for recreational fishing
- Size restrictions (minimum tail weights for lobster imports)
- Seasonal closures for specific species
- Area closures (Bajo de Sico, Tourmaline Bank, Abrir La Sierra)
- Gear restrictions (anchor retrieval systems, prohibited fishing methods)
- Harvest prohibitions for certain species

**Performance Metrics:**
- Sustainable Yield Level (SYL) as proxy for MSY
- Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) by sector
- Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) levels
- Accountability Measures (AMs) trigger points

**Ecosystem Indicators:**
- Species-specific ACLs and SYLs for multiple stock complexes
- Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) designations
- Framework procedures for adaptive management

To provide the complete 500-word summary and full extraction of ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, and indicators, I would need access to the entire document, particularly the sections covering ecosystem management objectives and the full fishery ecosystem plan content.

I cannot summarize this PDF file because it appears to be a text snippet from one document rather than a complete fishery ecosystem plan. The text provided consists only of:

1. A partial paragraph discussing social effects of management alternatives related to accountability measures and harvest prohibitions
2. Chapter headings and beginnings for regulatory impact review, list of preparers, and references sections

This appears to be excerpted from pages 362-403 of a Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan/Environmental Assessment, but it does not contain the complete document needed to provide a comprehensive 500-word summary or to identify the ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and indicators you requested.

To properly complete your request, I would need access to the full fishery ecosystem plan document, particularly:

- Executive summary or introduction sections
- Sections outlining ecosystem policies and goals
- Management objectives and approaches
- Performance metrics and monitoring plans
- Ecosystem indicators framework

The text snippet you've provided appears to focus on social and economic impact analysis rather than the core ecosystem management framework. If you can provide the complete document or the relevant sections containing the ecosystem management plan details, I'd be happy to provide the requested summary and analysis.

I cannot see the full text of the PDF document you're referring to, as you've only provided what appears to be a references/citations section and some appendices. The text you've shared contains primarily bibliographic references and regulatory history tables, but not the main content of the fishery ecosystem plan that would contain the ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and ecosystem indicators you've asked me to summarize.

To provide you with the requested 500-word summary and detailed breakdown of ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and ecosystem indicators, I would need access to the main body of the Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan document, particularly sections that discuss:

- The plan's ecosystem approach and policies
- Stated goals and objectives 
- Management strategies and approaches
- Performance metrics and monitoring systems
- Specific ecosystem indicators

The section you've provided appears to be from Chapter 10 (References) and the Appendices, which contain supporting information but not the core management framework of the plan.

Could you please share the main sections of the document that contain the fishery ecosystem plan's substantive management content? This would typically be found in chapters covering the management framework, objectives, and implementation strategies.

I don't have the complete PDF document to provide a comprehensive 500-word summary of the fishery ecosystem plan. However, I can analyze the section you've specifically requested that I summarize.

## Summary of the Specified Section

The specified section appears to be part of a chronological table documenting major management actions for Puerto Rico's fishery management plans. This particular excerpt describes several key conservation measures:

**Grammanik Bank Closure**: A seasonal closure was established in the area known as Grammanik Bank south of St. Thomas, prohibiting all fishing activities from February 1 through April 30 of each year. This closure was designed to protect critical spawning areas during peak reproductive periods.

**Species-Specific Seasonal Closures**: The document establishes comprehensive seasonal fishing closures for various commercially important fish species, each timed to correspond with their spawning seasons:
- Silk, black, blackfin and vermillion snapper: October 1 - December 31
- Tiger, yellowfin, yellowedge, red and black grouper: February 1 - April 30  
- Red hind: December 1 - February 28/29
- Lane and mutton snapper: April 1 - June 30

**Management Reference Points**: In the absence of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) estimates, the plan established a proxy formula: MSY = C/[(F_CURR/F_MSY) × (B_CURR/B_MSY)], where C represents recent average catch calculated from commercial landings (1997-2001 for Puerto Rico, 1994-2002 for USVI) and recreational landings (2000-2001).

**Stock Status Assessment Framework**: For species with unknown stock status, the plan implemented a tiered approach using different biomass and fishing mortality ratio proxies:
- Species "not at risk": F_CURR/F_MSY = 0.75, B_CURR/B_MSY = 1.25
- Species with uncertain status: Both ratios = 1.00
- Species "at risk": F_CURR/F_MSY = 1.50, B_CURR/B_MSY = 0.75

These measures represent a precautionary approach to fisheries management, implementing protective measures during vulnerable life stages while establishing scientific frameworks for ongoing stock assessment and management decisions.

Without access to the complete document, I cannot provide the requested comprehensive summary or detailed listing of ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and specific ecosystem indicators. To provide this information, I would need access to the full fishery ecosystem plan document.

I notice that your request to summarize the PDF appears to be incomplete - the text cuts off mid-sentence at the end, and you've included what appears to be species tables and appendices rather than the main document content.

However, based on the partial content provided, I can see this is a Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan (FMP) document. Here's what I can determine from the available text:

## Summary (Based on Available Content):

This appears to be a fishery ecosystem plan for Puerto Rico's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The document establishes management frameworks for various fish stocks and marine species in Puerto Rico waters. Key elements include:

**Management Structure:**
- Reorganizes species into new stock complexes compared to the previous Caribbean-wide Reef Fish FMP
- Establishes criteria for species inclusion/exclusion from management
- Implements a tiered Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) control rule system

**Species Coverage:**
The plan manages numerous species groups including:
- Snappers (6 units/complexes)
- Groupers (6 units) 
- Parrotfish (2 units)
- Aquarium trade reef fish and invertebrates
- Various coral species (hard corals, soft corals, gorgonian corals, black corals)
- Echinoderms (sea urchins, sea cucumbers)

**Key Features:**
- Uses a 4-tier ABC control rule responding to different data availability levels
- Most stocks fall under Tier 4 (data-limited approach) using Sustainable Yield Level (SYL)
- Includes extensive species lists for management consideration
- Addresses both commercial and recreational fisheries

**Limitations:**
Unfortunately, without the complete document, I cannot provide the specific ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and ecosystem indicators you requested. The text appears to cut off in the middle of technical details about the ABC control rule process.

To provide a complete 500-word summary and the detailed policy framework you've requested, I would need access to the full document, particularly the sections containing the management objectives, policies, and performance metrics.

# Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan (FMP) Summary

## Summary (500 words)

The Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan and Environmental Assessment represents a comprehensive framework for transitioning from the existing Reef Fish and Coral FMPs to a single, place-based management approach for the Puerto Rico Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This integrated document addresses federal mandates under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, particularly the requirement to establish Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) and accountability measures for all federally managed species.

The plan establishes a new management structure organized around stock complexes based on taxonomic relationships, life history characteristics, and fishing patterns. Species are grouped into functional categories including reef fish (snappers, groupers, parrotfish), pelagic fish (tunas, mackerels, dolphin), benthic invertebrates (spiny lobster, queen conch, sea urchins, sea cucumbers), and rays. Some species like Nassau grouper, goliath grouper, and certain parrotfish receive special protection due to conservation concerns.

The FMP implements a data-limited catch control rule approach using ABC CR Tiers 4a and 4b to establish Sustainable Yield Levels (SYLs) and Acceptable Biological Catches (ABCs). These calculations incorporate historical landings data, species vulnerability assessments, and variability adjustment factors. The ABC Control Rule uses specific year sequences of commercial and recreational landings data (typically excluding 2005 due to data quality issues) and applies the 75th percentile of landings for Tier 4a stocks and mean landings for Tier 4b stocks.

For ACL calculations, the plan applies scientific uncertainty buffers, with most stocks receiving a 0.5 reduction factor, though spiny lobster receives 0.6. Additional reductions are applied when unspecified landings exceed 10% of reference period data. Most species receive management uncertainty buffers of 0.95 (5% reduction), while angelfish, parrotfish, and surgeonfish receive more conservative 0.85 buffers.

The document addresses significant data collection challenges in Puerto Rico, including reporting delays, non-reporting issues, and the need for improved fishery-independent data. Commercial data collection relies on trip tickets submitted to Puerto Rico's Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER), while recreational data comes from the Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP), though this was suspended after Hurricane María in 2017.

Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) designations are established for species new to federal management, recognizing the critical importance of coral reef ecosystems, mangrove areas, seagrass beds, and offshore waters. The plan acknowledges the interconnected nature of Caribbean marine ecosystems and the need for habitat protection alongside fishery management.

The FMP incorporates ecosystem considerations by addressing habitat degradation, climate change impacts, and species interactions. It recognizes that traditional single-species management approaches may be insufficient for the complex, multi-species tropical fisheries of Puerto Rico.

Data quality concerns are pervasive throughout the plan, with limited life history information, incomplete stock assessments, and uncertainty in landings data. The document emphasizes the need for improved data collection systems, including electronic reporting, better enforcement of reporting requirements, and enhanced coordination among various fishery-independent survey programs.

The plan represents a practical approach to managing data-poor tropical fisheries while meeting federal mandates, though it acknowledges substantial scientific uncertainty and the need for adaptive management as better information becomes available.

## Ecosystem Policies, Goals, and Objectives

The document does not explicitly state formal ecosystem policies, goals, and objectives in a dedicated section. However, ecosystem considerations are integrated throughout the management approach rather than being formally articulated as a separate ecosystem management framework.

## Summary of ABC Control Rule Section (Year Sequences and 75th Percentile)

The document describes the methodology for establishing year sequences used in calculating Sustainable Yield Levels (SYLs) and Acceptable Biological Catches (ABCs):

**Year Sequence Selection Criteria:**
- Sequences chosen to provide stable periods of data availability
- Year 2005 excluded from all sequences due to aberrant adjustment factors that artificially inflated landings
- Different sequences selected for different species based on data availability and stability
- Commercial and recreational sectors may have different year sequences

**Commercial Year Sequences Selected:**
- 1988-2011 (excluding 2005): Most species including spiny lobster, queen conch, most snapper/grouper complexes, parrotfish, triggerfish, etc.
- 2000-2011 (excluding 2005): Snapper 2 and Grouper 5
- 1988-2016 (excluding 2005): Dolphin, tripletail, jacks, rays
- 1999-2016 (excluding 2005): Tunas and mackerels
- 2010-2016: Wahoo
- 1988-2004: Barracuda

**Recreational Year Sequences Selected:**
- 2000-2011: Most reef fish species (snappers, groupers, parrotfish, etc.)
- 2000-2016: Pelagic species (dolphin, tunas, mackerels, wahoo, barracuda, jacks, rays)

**75th Percentile Calculation:**
The 75th percentile represents the landings level below which 75% of the annual landings during the reference period fall. For the ABC Control Rule:
- **Tier 4a stocks**: Use 75th percentile of landings × scalar to calculate SYL
- **Tier 4b stocks**: Use mean landings × scalar to calculate SYL

The document provides a detailed example:
- Five years of hypothetical data: 5,000; 12,000; 8,000; 22,000; 14,000
- Ordered from smallest to largest: 5,000; 8,000; 12,000; 14,000; 22,000
- 75th percentile = 14,000
- Mean = 12,200

**Variability Adjustment Factor (VAF):**
VAF = (max susceptibility score - CV)/max susceptibility score, where:
- Maximum susceptibility score = 3
- CV (coefficient of variation) = standard deviation/mean
- CV capped at 1.0 to prevent ABC from declining when variability exceeds certain thresholds

**Scalar Calculation:**
Scalar = VAF × (inverted) susceptibility score
- Used to multiply the 75th percentile (Tier 4a) or mean (Tier 4b) to determine SYL

**Scientific Uncertainty Buffer:**
ABC = SYL × reduction factor (typically 0.5, or 0.6 for spiny lobster)
- Additional reductions applied if unspecified landings >10% of reference period data

This methodology attempts to balance allowing for fishery expansion (Tier 4a stocks with lower vulnerability) while maintaining conservative management (Tier 4b stocks with higher vulnerability) in a data-limited environment.

Based on the provided excerpt from this fishery ecosystem plan appendix, I cannot provide a complete 500-word summary as this appears to be only a portion focused on species descriptions rather than the full ecosystem plan. However, I can summarize the content that is present:

## Summary of Available Content

This appendix section describes fish and invertebrate species proposed for management under the Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The document covers multiple taxonomic groups:

**Reef Fish Species** including:
- Cubera snapper (*Lutjanus cyanopterus*) - distributed from Nova Scotia to Brazil, found in various habitats from shallow rocky shorelines to mesophotic reefs (30-50m depth), functioning as top demersal predators
- Yellowmouth grouper (*Mycteroperca intersticialis*) - reef-associated species in rocky/coral areas, with juveniles present at potential nursery sites like Bajo de Sico
- Gray triggerfish (*Balistes capriscus*) - widespread Atlantic distribution, associated with Sargassum mats as juveniles

**Pelagic Species** including:
- Dolphinfish (*Coryphaena hippurus*) - circumtropical oceanic species associated with floating objects and Sargassum
- Various tunas, mackerels, jacks, and other pelagic fish with seasonal migration patterns
- Great barracuda (*Sphyraena barracuda*) - found from nearshore to open waters

**Rays and Other Species** including:
- Giant manta ray (*Manta birostris*) - circumglobal threatened species
- Various stingrays and other cartilaginous fish

**Invertebrates** including:
- Queen conch (*Lobatus gigas*) - found on sandy/seagrass bottoms to 250 ft depth
- Caribbean spiny lobster (*Panulirus argus*) - occurs from shallow mangroves to 100m depth
- Sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and corals

## Missing Information

Since this appears to be only the species description appendix, I cannot identify:
- Stated ecosystem policies, goals, and objectives
- Management approaches
- Performance metrics
- Specific ecosystem indicators

The document references that ecosystem policies and management frameworks would be found in the main body of the FMP, but those sections are not included in this excerpt. To provide the complete analysis requested, the full fishery ecosystem plan document would be needed, particularly sections covering ecosystem-based management objectives, policies, and performance measurement frameworks.

I cannot provide a 500-word summary or detailed ecosystem information for the document you've shared, as you appear to have provided only taxonomic and species descriptions from appendices of a Puerto Rico fishery ecosystem plan, not the complete document containing ecosystem policies, goals, and objectives.

## Summary of the Provided Content (approximately 500 words):

The document section contains detailed biological profiles of fish species managed under the Puerto Rico Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The species descriptions include snappers, groupers, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes, wrasses, angelfishes, grunts, jacks, and various other marine species, as well as echinoderms and corals.

**Snappers (Lutjanidae)** include multiple commercially important species such as blackfin snapper, silk snapper, vermilion snapper, and yellowtail snapper. These species typically inhabit depths ranging from 20-400 meters, with varying life histories and spawning patterns. Most snappers are moderately to low resilience species with population doubling times of 1.4-14 years.

**Groupers (Serranidae)** are characterized as long-lived, slow-growing species managed as individual stocks and stock complexes. Notable species include Nassau grouper and goliath grouper (both prohibited from harvest), along with various others like red grouper, black grouper, and tiger grouper. Many groupers are protogynous hermaphrodites that form spawning aggregations at specific locations and times.

**Parrotfishes (Scaridae)** are herbivorous coral reef species that play crucial ecological roles in reef ecosystems through their algae consumption and sand production. Six species are managed in two stock complexes, including blue parrotfish, rainbow parrotfish, and various Scarus and Sparisoma species.

**Other managed species** include surgeonfishes (three species in one complex), triggerfishes (three species), wrasses (individual hogfish stock and one complex), angelfishes (three species in one complex), white grunt, various jacks, rays, and tunas.

**Echinoderms** encompass all sea urchin and sea cucumber species within the Puerto Rico EEZ, though specific biological details are referenced to Appendix I.

**Corals** include a comprehensive range from Class Hydrozoa (fire corals and lace corals) to Class Anthozoa (black corals, soft corals, gorgonians, sea pens, and reef-building stony corals). Fire corals play significant roles in reef construction, particularly in shallow windward areas.

The species profiles typically include information on distribution and habitat, life history characteristics (maximum size, growth rates, maturity, resilience), diet, and reproduction/spawning patterns. Many species show spawning peaks during specific months, often associated with lunar cycles, and several form spawning aggregations at documented locations around Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

## Missing Information:

To provide the requested detailed analysis of ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and specific ecosystem indicators, I would need access to the main body of the Puerto Rico Fishery Ecosystem Plan document, as the section you've shared contains only species-specific biological appendices. The ecosystem management framework information would typically be found in the main FMP chapters, not in the species description appendices.

I cannot provide a summary of this PDF fishery ecosystem plan document because the content you've shared appears to only contain appendices focusing on specific species descriptions (gorgonians and corals) and consultation histories, rather than the main body of the fishery ecosystem plan that would contain the core policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, and performance metrics.

## Summary of Provided Section (Coral and Gorgonian Species)

The provided section describes various coral and gorgonian species found in Caribbean reef ecosystems:

**Gorgonians (Sea Fans, Sea Plumes, Sea Rods):**
- *Gorgonia ventalina* (common sea fan): Most abundant gorgonian, found 1-25m depth, up to 1.5m height
- *Gorgonia flabellum* (Venus sea fan): Occurs in shallower, rougher areas than G. ventalina, rarely below 10m
- *Gorgonia mariae* (wide-mesh sea fan): Smallest sea fan species, reaches 30-40cm height, deeper water species (5-47m)
- *Pseudopterogorgia* spp. (sea plumes): Tall, plume-like colonies reaching 1.5m+ height
- *Eunicea* spp. (sea rods): Important reef-dwelling group, occurs few meters to 30m depth
- Various other genera including *Muricea*, *Plexaura*, and *Plexaurella*

**Hard Corals (Scleractinia):**
- *Acropora cervicornis* (staghorn coral): Fast-growing, found 6-50m depth, most common 12-22m
- *A. palmata* (elkhorn coral): Dominant shallow-water coral, thrives in rough conditions, rarely below 15m
- Various brain corals (*Diploria* spp.), star corals (*Montastrea* spp.), and other reef-building species
- *Dendrogyra cylindricus* (pillar coral): Spectacular species reaching 3m height with upright cylindrical branches

**Black Corals (Antipatharia):**
- *Antipathes* spp. and *Stichopathes* spp., harvested for jewelry trade, typically deep-sea and slow-growing

The section notes that gorgonians have low and variable recruitment, making adult survival critical for population persistence. These species serve as important habitat for other managed species and face threats from various predators and boring organisms.

To provide the comprehensive 500-word summary you requested, along with the specific ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and ecosystem indicators, I would need access to the main body of the fishery ecosystem plan document.
