# Fishery Ecosystem Plan II of the South Atlantic Region - Summary

## Overview

The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) approved Fishery Ecosystem Plan II (FEP II) in March 2018 as a mechanism to incorporate ecosystem principles, goals, and policies into fishery management processes. Originally conceived as a living web-based document, FEP II was compiled into this comprehensive document in February 2024 due to staffing limitations and the approval of the new Habitat Blueprint in September 2023.

## Key Components

**Geographic Scope**: The plan covers the South Atlantic region from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to the Florida Keys, extending from intertidal zones to 500m depth, encompassing approximately 174,331 kmÂ².

**Ecosystem Approach**: FEP II emphasizes ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), explicitly considering indirect effects of fisheries through food web processes, connectivity between habitats, and the integration of environmental and human factors.

## Major Sections

### Section 1: South Atlantic Ecosystem
Details food web connectivity and climate variability, describing three primary food webs:
- **Estuarine**: Dominated by seagrasses, marsh grasses, oyster reefs, and detritus-based energy flow
- **Nearshore**: Mix of soft and hard bottom habitats supporting diverse fish communities  
- **Offshore**: Live/hard bottom habitats supporting commercially important snappers, groupers, and other reef fish

## Summary (500 words)

This South Atlantic Fishery Ecosystem Plan document focuses on the critical role of food webs, connectivity, and climate variability in ecosystem-based fisheries management. The plan examines how diverse habitats in the South Atlantic support interconnected food webs linked by energy pathways, species migrations, and life history connections spanning from algae to marine mammals.

The document emphasizes that South Atlantic food webs are regulated by both bottom-up environmental factors (temperature, upwelling, nutrient loading) and top-down controls (fishing pressure, predation). Energy flow is heavily mediated by predator-prey interactions, with forage species like menhaden, shrimp, and pinfish serving as critical energy transfer links. Unfortunately, population dynamics of these key forage species remain poorly understood.

Climate variability and change emerge as major drivers affecting marine ecosystems through multiple pathways. Temperature sets geographic boundaries for species ranges, with climate change causing spatial distribution shifts as species track preferred thermal envelopes. Mobile pelagic species respond rapidly through directed movement, while benthic species face more complex responses dependent on suitable habitat availability. The document notes that rapid temperature changes in recent years have led to unexpected high catches of species like cobia and blueline tilefish in mid-Atlantic waters.

The plan identifies several critical climate impacts: phenological shifts in reproductive timing and migrations; altered larval dispersal and connectivity patterns; disrupted trophic interactions through match-mismatch dynamics; increased disease prevalence; and expansion of invasive species like lionfish. Ocean acidification poses additional threats to calcifying organisms, while sea level rise will directly impact fishing communities and infrastructure.

Food web modeling approaches are presented as essential tools for understanding ecosystem dynamics and informing management decisions. The document reviews indicators for energy flow, resilience, and structure that can serve as benchmarks for ecosystem health. These models can provide time-varying natural mortality estimates for stock assessments, evaluate policy options for unintended consequences, and examine ecological trade-offs under different ecosystem scenarios.

The plan acknowledges significant data gaps, particularly for non-commercially important species, pelagic species, and offshore environments. Basic diet, energy, and biomass information for these species is crucial for developing effective ecosystem models and reducing uncertainty in management applications.

Key management applications include informing stock assessments with ecosystem-derived parameters, evaluating multiple policy options simultaneously across species, and using indicators to track ecosystem status. The document emphasizes that ecosystem-based management doesn't require complete abandonment of single-species approaches but rather integration of ecosystem considerations into existing frameworks.

The plan concludes with comprehensive recommendations addressing forage fisheries management, food web connectivity maintenance, understanding of trophic pathways, model development, indicator implementation, invasive species control, and contaminant monitoring. Research priorities focus on climate impact studies, habitat characterization, forage fish ecology, basic data collection, ecosystem-level products development, risk assessments, management strategy evaluations, ecosystem reference points, and essential fish habitat protection.

## Ecosystem Policies, Goals, Objectives, Management Approaches, Performance Metrics, and Indicators

Based on my review of this document, it appears to be a technical/scientific chapter focusing on food webs, connectivity, and climate considerations rather than a comprehensive management plan with clearly stated formal policies, goals, and objectives. The document is primarily descriptive and analytical, presenting scientific information to support ecosystem-based management rather than establishing specific management frameworks.

However, the document does identify several **management approaches and recommendations:**

### Management Approaches Identified:

**Note:** This document appears to be a scientific foundation/technical chapter rather than a formal fishery management plan with explicit regulatory goals and objectives. The recommendations provided serve as guidance for implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management approaches rather than mandated management measures.

I cannot provide a complete 500-word summary as the document appears to be cut off mid-sentence and contains only portions of what appears to be a larger fishery ecosystem plan. However, I can summarize the available sections:

## Summary of Available Sections

The document discusses climate variability and fisheries management in the South Atlantic region. Key topics include:

**Climate Impacts**: The text emphasizes that fishing is a social-ecological system where climate change impacts must be considered alongside fisher behavior and species exploitation patterns. Climate effects can influence species establishment, population dynamics, and fishery transitions.

**Knowledge Gaps and Research Priorities**: The document identifies several critical research needs:
- Enhanced ocean observations, particularly for monitoring Gulf Stream changes, wind patterns, precipitation, pH, oxygen, and temperature
- Improved regional climate prediction models for decadal timescales (10-40 years)
- Better understanding of species and habitat vulnerability to climate change
- Assessment of social impacts and fisheries responses to climate variability
- Development of climate indicators for management
- Addressing major observation gaps in biological data

**Management Applications**: The text discusses incorporating climate information into fisheries management through Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE), developing environmental indicators, and applying adaptive management principles given climate uncertainty.

**Coral Reef Habitat Section**: The latter portion covers shallow water coral ecosystems in the South Atlantic, describing reef biogeography from North Carolina to the Dry Tortugas, ecological functions, current management frameworks including Essential Fish Habitat designations, and ongoing threats.

## Incomplete Information

The document appears to cut off during the coral reef references section, so I cannot provide information about:
- Complete ecosystem policies, goals, and objectives
- Specific performance metrics and ecosystem indicators
- Details about buybacks, alternative fisheries, subsidy reduction, and endowment funds as requested

The document would need to be provided in its entirety to deliver the comprehensive analysis you've requested, particularly regarding the specific management approaches and the section on economic instruments you mentioned.

I cannot provide a summary of this entire document as it appears to be a partial section from a larger fishery ecosystem plan, ending mid-sentence. What I can provide is a summary and analysis of the "Shallow Water Corals" section, which is the most complete portion:

## Summary of Shallow Water Corals Section (500 words)

This section addresses the management of shallow water corals in the South Atlantic region, focusing on both stony corals (scleractinians) and octocorals (gorgonians and soft corals). The document defines prohibited corals under federal regulations as those belonging to Class Hydrozoa (fire corals) and Class Anthozoa, including stony corals and black corals.

**Taxonomy and Biology**: Stony corals are marine invertebrates that secrete calcium carbonate skeletons, with most reef-building species hosting symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae). They reproduce both sexually through complex spawning/brooding systems and asexually through fragmentation. Growth rates vary significantly, with mounding corals growing slowly (less than 1 cm/year) while branching species like Acropora can exceed 10 cm/year. Octocorals have proteinaceous skeletons and generally higher growth rates than stony corals.

**Population Status**: In Southeast Florida, coral cover remains low (2-5%) with small colony sizes, dominated by six key species including Montastraea cavernosa and Siderastrea siderea. While populations showed stability through 2015, severe thermal stress and disease outbreaks have since caused dramatic declines. In the Florida Keys, coral reefs are in transition following decades of disease and bleaching, with 2015 coral cover at 6.2%. Octocorals show variable trends, increasing in the Keys but decreasing in Southeast Florida.

**Major Threats**: Climate change poses the greatest threat, with documented warming trends and projected annual bleaching within a decade. Mass bleaching events occurred in 1997-98, 2005, 2014, and 2015. A current white-plague disease outbreak affects at least 13 species and has been called "one of the most lethal ever recorded." Historical disease outbreaks devastated Acropora species by nearly 100% in many areas. Additional threats include poor water quality from coastal development, sedimentation, and the 1983 Diadema sea urchin die-off that removed critical herbivory.

**Management Framework**: Scleractinian corals are managed under zero-take regulations and protected as Essential Fish Habitat-Habitat Areas of Particular Concern. Seven species are listed as threatened under the ESA. Octocorals are managed by Florida with recreational limits of six colonies per day and commercial quotas of 70,000 colonies annually, with various area closures in place.

**Knowledge Gaps and Recommendations**: Critical research needs include evaluating restoration strategies, determining impact thresholds for stressors, understanding disease causation and remediation, and assessing turbidity effects on all coral life stages. Management recommendations include population enhancement programs, mooring ball installation, improved legal enforcement, better coastal construction permitting, and development of protective turbidity standards.

The section concludes that mounting global and local threats have caused drastic coral declines throughout the Caribbean, with the South Atlantic region experiencing severe impacts that require immediate management intervention and enhanced protection measures.

## Ecosystem Policies, Goals, and Objectives

## Summary (500 words)

This document appears to be an excerpt from a South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) Fishery Ecosystem Plan focusing on habitat types and managed species in the South Atlantic region. The content covers several key habitat types and provides detailed species accounts for various managed fish species.

**Habitat Types:**
The document extensively covers Live/Hard Bottom Habitat, which is found throughout the South Atlantic Bight from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to Cape Canaveral, Florida. This habitat is divided into distinct depth zones: nearshore (0-5m), inner-shelf (5-20m), mid-shelf (20-30m), outer-shelf (30-50m), shelf-edge (50-100m), upper-slope (100-300m), mid-slope (300-400m), and deep offshore (>400m). Each zone supports different fish assemblages and serves various ecological functions including nursery areas, spawning grounds, and adult habitat.

Nearshore hardbottom habitats, particularly off east Florida, are characterized by coquina ridges and shell formations that provide critical settlement and nursery habitat for numerous reef fish species. The document notes that these areas support over 30 times more fish individuals than adjacent sand habitats. Mid-shelf areas include important protected areas like Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary off Georgia.

The document also covers artificial reefs, which provide additional hard substrate but may function differently than natural reefs in terms of fish assemblages and reproductive output. Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) designations are discussed for various hardbottom types, with specific areas identified as Habitats of Particular Concern (HAPCs) including the Charleston Bump, Ten Fathom Ledge, and nearshore hardbottom areas.

**Managed Species:**
The species accounts focus primarily on the Serranidae family (sea basses and groupers). Detailed profiles are provided for:

- **Black Sea Bass** (Centropristis striata): A temperate species that undergoes ontogenetic habitat shifts from estuarine nurseries to offshore reefs, with protogynous sex change at about 4 years.
- **Bank Sea Bass** (Centropristis ocyurus): A smaller species found on shelf-edge habitats, living 7-8 years with sex transition occurring between 5-7 inches.
- **Red Grouper** (Epinephelus morio): An important commercial species that creates habitat modifications through excavation activities, living over 25 years.
- **Gag** (Mycteroperca microlepis): A large grouper with complex life history including estuarine juvenile stages and offshore spawning aggregations.
- **Scamp** (Mycteroperca phenax): A medium-sized grouper preferring low-profile live-bottom areas.
- **Snowy Grouper** (Hyporthodus niveatus): A deepwater species found on continental shelf edges and upper slopes.
- **Speckled Hind** (Epinephelus drummondhayi): A distinctive deepwater grouper with protracted spawning seasons.

All species described are protogynous hermaphrodites (changing from female to male) and are managed under the SAFMC Snapper Grouper Fishery Management Plan with various regulations including size limits, bag limits, seasonal closures, and annual catch limits. The document emphasizes the importance of habitat protection for these species' life cycles and the interconnectedness between estuarine nursery areas and offshore adult habitats.

## Ecosystem Policies, Goals, Objectives, and Management Approaches

I cannot provide the complete list of ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and ecosystem indicators as requested because this information is not present in the text provided. The document appears to be primarily focused on habitat descriptions and species accounts rather than management frameworks. To provide this information, I would need access to the complete fishery ecosystem plan document that contains the management sections.

## Specific Section Summary Request

You mentioned wanting a summary of a section about "ath grouper presence and abundance in the eastern Gulf of Mexico" but this content is not present in the text you provided. What you've shared appears to be a references/bibliography section listing various scientific papers and reports related to artificial reefs, fish assemblages, and habitat studies, followed by habitat and species descriptions. The specific section you referenced is not included in the material provided.

I cannot provide a complete summary of the fishery ecosystem plan as the document section you've provided appears to focus specifically on species profiles rather than the full ecosystem plan. However, I can summarize the species information provided:

## Summary of Document Section (500 words)

This section provides detailed species profiles for fish managed under the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council's Snapper Grouper Fishery Management Plan. The profiles cover various taxonomic groups including groupers, tilefishes, triggerfishes, jacks, porgies, snappers, grunts, wrasses, spadefishes, wreckfishes, and coastal migratory pelagics.

**Groupers** represent a major component, including species like Rock Hind, Red Hind, Graysby, Yellowfin Grouper, Coney, Yellowmouth Grouper, Goliath Grouper, Nassau Grouper, Yellowedge Grouper, Warsaw Grouper, and Misty Grouper. Most are protogynous hermaphrodites that change from female to male with age/size. Critical concerns include habitat loss (especially for Goliath Grouper juveniles dependent on mangroves and seagrass), spawning aggregation vulnerability, and long lifespans making them susceptible to overfishing.

**Tilefishes** include Blueline, Golden, and Sand Tilefish, which inhabit deeper continental shelf waters and construct burrows. They are long-lived, slow-growing species with extended spawning seasons.

**Snappers** encompass commercially important species like Red Snapper, Vermilion Snapper, and Yellowtail Snapper, along with deeper-water species like Queen Snapper and Silk Snapper. Most are gonochoristic (separate sexes) and form spawning aggregations.

**Coastal Migratory Pelagics** include highly mobile species like King Mackerel, Spanish Mackerel, Cobia, Wahoo, and Dolphin. These species undertake seasonal migrations and support significant recreational and commercial fisheries.

All species face similar management challenges including habitat degradation, fishing pressure on spawning aggregations, and climate-related distribution shifts. Management approaches consistently include annual catch limits, size and bag limits, trip limits, gear restrictions, and seasonal closures (particularly during spawning periods). Some species like Goliath Grouper and Nassau Grouper are completely closed to harvest due to severe population declines.

The document emphasizes the importance of structured habitats (reefs, wrecks, live-bottom) for most species, particularly during different life stages. Juvenile habitat requirements often differ from adults, with many species using nearshore, estuarine, or seagrass areas as nurseries before moving to deeper adult habitats.

Conservation concerns are prominent throughout, with several species showing evidence of overfishing, habitat loss, and recruitment challenges. The loss of critical habitats like mangroves (>90% lost in some areas) particularly affects species like Goliath Grouper. Spawning aggregation sites require special protection due to their predictable nature making fish vulnerable to targeted fishing pressure.

## Ecosystem Policies, Goals, and Objectives

Unfortunately, the document section provided does not contain the ecosystem-level policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, or ecosystem indicators. The section focuses exclusively on individual species profiles with their biological characteristics, habitat requirements, and species-specific management measures. To provide the requested analysis of ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and ecosystem indicators, I would need access to the ecosystem planning sections of the document that contain this higher-level strategic information.

I cannot provide a complete summary of this fishery ecosystem plan because the text provided appears to be only a small section (pages 241-288) focusing primarily on species descriptions (pompano dolphin, various shrimp species, crabs, lobsters, coral, and Sargassum) and Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) designations rather than the full 500-word summary requested.

## Summary of Available Section

This section describes key managed species and habitats in the South Atlantic region:

**Species Management:**
- Pompano Dolphin managed alongside common dolphin under the Dolphin Wahoo FMP with unified regulations
- Six shrimp species (Brown, Pink, White, Seabob, Rock, and Royal Red) managed as annual crops with targets/thresholds based on landings and CPUE data rather than traditional overfishing thresholds
- Golden Crab managed in deep continental slope waters (200-1000m depth)
- Caribbean Spiny Lobster managed with complex life cycle considerations
- Coral species protected as essential fish habitat for other managed species
- Pelagic Sargassum managed as critical floating habitat

**Essential Fish Habitat Framework:**
The section extensively details EFH designations across multiple fishery management plans, including specific habitat types, geographic boundaries, and Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPCs). EFH extends from the Virginia/North Carolina border to the Dry Tortugas, covering inshore to offshore waters.

**Food Web Policy:**
Establishes policies addressing ecosystem connectivity, forage fisheries, trophic pathways, and food web modeling to support ecosystem-based fisheries management.

I'll provide a 500-word summary followed by the detailed extraction of ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, and related information as requested.

## Summary of Fishery Ecosystem Plan (500 words)

This South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) document focuses on ecosystem-based fishery management in the South Atlantic Bight (SAB). The species table shows abundant marine species including sciaenids, blue crabs, rays, and sharks, with forage species like menhaden, anchovies, and squid playing crucial roles as energy pathways supporting valuable commercial and recreational fish stocks and marine wildlife.

The document establishes comprehensive policies addressing climate variability impacts on fisheries. Climate change is altering fish distributions, with species like black sea bass and cobia shifting ranges in response to changing ocean temperatures and conditions. These changes affect catchability, stock assessments, and management strategies. The SAB ecosystem faces multiple stressors including temperature fluctuations, ocean acidification, sea level rise, and changing productivity patterns.

Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) designations encompass diverse marine environments from wetlands and submerged aquatic vegetation to coral reefs and deep-water habitats. EFH-Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPCs) include critical areas like coral CHAPCs, sandy shoals, nursery habitats, and spawning areas. These habitats support managed species including snapper-grouper complexes, coastal migratory pelagics, shrimp, spiny lobster, and highly migratory species.

Energy exploration and development policies address potential threats from oil, gas, wind, and hydrokinetic projects. Key concerns include direct organism mortality, sedimentation impacts on coral reefs, water quality alterations, habitat conversion, and cumulative effects. The Council mandates comprehensive EFH assessments, avoidance of sensitive areas, and compensatory mitigation when impacts are unavoidable.

Marine aquaculture policies recognize both positive and negative habitat interactions. Risks include species escapement, disease transmission, chemical use, and benthic impacts from organic loading. However, aquaculture can benefit EFH through habitat restoration like oyster reef reconstruction and nutrient sequestration. The policies distinguish between onshore, nearshore, and offshore aquaculture operations, each presenting different risk profiles and management requirements.

The ecosystem approach emphasizes cumulative impact assessment, precautionary management under uncertainty, and adaptive strategies. Management policies prioritize habitat protection through avoidance and minimization, with mitigation as a last resort. The Council advocates for ecosystem resilience, climate-ready fisheries, and integration of environmental indicators into stock assessments.

Regulatory frameworks involve multiple jurisdictions and agencies, requiring coordination between federal, state, and interstate management bodies. The policies integrate existing authorities under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, Clean Water Act, and various habitat protection statutes.

The forage fish component highlights species critical to food web energy transfer, including Atlantic menhaden, anchovies, sardines, and small pelagic species. These organisms support both managed fisheries and broader ecosystem functions, requiring ecosystem-level management consideration.

The document reflects evolving understanding of marine ecosystem complexity, emphasizing the need for comprehensive monitoring, research, and adaptive management approaches to address multiple stressors while maintaining ecosystem productivity and resilience in a changing ocean environment.

I apologize, but I cannot see the full PDF document you referenced. The text you've provided appears to be pages 320-360 from what seems to be a fishery ecosystem plan that discusses marine aquaculture and the Submerged Lands Act.

From the section you've provided, I can summarize the following about the Submerged Lands Act portion:

## Submerged Lands Act Summary

The document references the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.) in the context of marine aquaculture activities and their potential interactions with Essential Fish Habitat (EFH). The section discusses how aquaculture operations can affect various habitat types including:

- Coral, coral reef and live/hard bottom habitat
- Marine and estuarine waters  
- Estuarine wetlands, including mangroves and marshes
- Submerged aquatic vegetation
- Waters that support diadromous fishes and their spawning/nursery habitats
- Waters hydrologically and ecologically connected to EFH waters

The document outlines environmental effects of shellfish and finfish aquaculture, noting that while poorly managed operations can negatively impact benthic communities and water quality, improved regulatory practices are reducing these risks. It distinguishes between nearshore and offshore aquaculture impacts and includes specific policies for marine aquaculture in federal waters.

However, to provide the comprehensive 500-word summary and complete policy analysis you requested, I would need access to the full document, particularly the sections containing the stated ecosystem policies, goals, objectives, management approaches, performance metrics, and ecosystem indicators. Could you please provide the complete document or the specific sections containing this information?

# Fishery Ecosystem Plan Summary

This 500-word summary covers key aspects of the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council's (SAFMC) Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP), which represents a comprehensive approach to ecosystem-based fishery management in the South Atlantic region from North Carolina to the Florida Keys.

## Plan Overview
The FEP serves as an umbrella document providing ecosystem context for the SAFMC's four species-specific Fishery Management Plans (FMPs): Snapper-Grouper, Shrimp, Coastal Migratory Pelagics, and Spiny Lobster/Stone Crab. The plan emphasizes managing fisheries within the broader ecosystem context rather than as isolated single-species units.

## Ecosystem Approach
The document establishes an ecosystem-based management framework that considers the interactions between managed species, their habitats, predators, prey, and environmental factors. This approach recognizes that healthy ecosystems are fundamental to sustainable fisheries and aims to maintain ecosystem integrity while supporting fishing communities.

## Habitat Protection
Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) protection is a cornerstone of the plan, with detailed designations for various habitat types including coral reefs, hard bottom areas, submerged aquatic vegetation, oyster reefs, and artificial reefs. The plan designates Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPCs) for critical areas like deepwater coral ecosystems, spawning aggregation sites, and nursery areas.

## Managed Areas
The FEP establishes a comprehensive system of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), Special Management Zones (SMZs), and Coral Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (CHAPCs). These areas serve multiple purposes including species protection, habitat conservation, and research opportunities. The Oculina Bank CHAPC and deepwater coral HAPCs are particularly significant for protecting vulnerable deep-sea ecosystems.

## Research and Monitoring
The plan prioritizes standardized data collection through programs like SEAMAP (Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program) and emphasizes the need for long-term monitoring of fish populations, habitat conditions, and ecosystem indicators. The South Atlantic Mapping Strategy focuses on characterizing benthic habitats and physical oceanographic features.

## Climate Change Adaptation
Recognizing climate change as a significant threat, the plan addresses ocean acidification, sea level rise, temperature changes, and shifting species distributions. It emphasizes the need for adaptive management strategies that can respond to changing environmental conditions.

## Policy Framework
The document includes detailed policy statements addressing various threats to marine ecosystems including coastal development, pollution, invasive species, and flow alterations from dams and water diversions. These policies provide guidance for habitat protection and restoration efforts.

# Flow Stabilization Summary

The document explains that flow stabilization below dams can create artificially constant environments that lack natural extremes necessary for maintaining ecosystem diversity and floodplain connectivity. While some flow regulation can benefit fish and invertebrate diversity and abundance, excessive stabilization reduces natural flow variability that many species depend on for spawning, feeding, and migration cues.

Natural flow regimes include baseflows, high pulse flows, and floods that occur with specific magnitude, frequency, duration, timing, and rate of change. These components are essential for maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems. The document emphasizes that mimicking or ensuring these natural flow characteristics is preferable to maintaining artificially constant flows.

Three main approaches are used for setting environmental flow standards: minimum flow thresholds, statistically-based standards, and percentage of flow approaches. Modern approaches increasingly use "sustainability boundaries" - bands of allowable alteration around natural flow conditions. Research suggests that alterations greater than 10% from natural daily flows risk ecological impacts, with alterations over 20% likely causing moderate to major ecosystem changes. A presumptive standard of protecting 80-90% of daily flows is recommended to maintain ecological integrity, with higher protection levels needed for rivers with at-risk species.

# State Policies and SAFMC Policies

## Current State Policies:

**North Carolina:** Requires registration and reporting of water withdrawals. Permits contain site-specific instream flow requirements determined by project specifics, with recommendations varying from percentage-based to seasonally variable flows.

**South Carolina:** Regulates surface water withdrawals under the Surface Water Permitting Act. Uses established seasonal minimum flows: Piedmont streams (20% July-November, 40% January-April, 30% May/June/December) and Coastal Plain streams (20% July-November, 60% January-April, 40% May/June/December).

**Georgia:** Implements a 2001 Interim Instream Flow Protection Strategy with three options: Monthly 7Q10 minimum flows, site-specific studies, or mean annual flow options (30% for direct withdrawals, 30/60/40% seasonal variations for reservoirs).

**Florida:** Five Water Management Districts establish minimum flows and levels (MFLs) to prevent significant harm to water resources and ecology, with recovery strategies required when flows fall below established MFLs.

## SAFMC Flow-Altering Project Policies:

The SAFMC establishes 17 comprehensive policies for flow-altering projects:

**Ecosystem Policies:**
- Protect and enhance Essential Fish Habitat, maintain ecosystem integrity, and restore natural flow regime components

**Goals:**
- Avoid, minimize, and offset damage to EFH, diadromous fish species, and critical habitats
- Ensure project compliance with water quality standards and species protection requirements

**Objectives:**
1. **Impact Assessment** - Require detailed analyses of short-term, long-term, population, and ecosystem-scale effects
2. **Alternatives Analysis** - Provide full range of project alternatives with impact assessments
3. **Impact Avoidance** - Avoid impacts shown to be preventable through alternatives analysis
4. **Mitigation** - Require compensatory mitigation for unavoidable impacts, monitored and locally implemented
5. **Baseline Monitoring** - Document pre-project conditions and ongoing project impacts
6. **Scientific Standards** - Base all assessments on best available science
7. **Cumulative Assessment** - Consider watershed-scale cumulative impacts
8. **Water Quality** - Meet federal and state standards through operational/structural modifications
9. **Timing Restrictions** - Avoid construction during sensitive species spawning/development periods
10. **Intake Design** - Prevent impingement/entrainment through proper screen design and placement
11. **Flow Regime Protection** - Minimize alterations to natural flow magnitude, frequency, duration, and timing
12. **Hydropower Operations** - Implement ramping restrictions and non-peaking windows during critical periods

**Management Approaches:**
- Expanded EFH consultation processes
- Local, up-front, in-kind mitigation requirements
- Multi-year post-construction monitoring programs
- Adaptive management based on monitoring results

**Performance Metrics:**
- Impingement and entrainment rates of sensitive species
- Bypass system mortality rates
- Compliance with design criteria and velocity requirements
- Water quality parameter maintenance (dissolved oxygen, temperature)

**Ecosystem Indicators:**
- Population status of diadromous fish species
- Habitat condition in EFH and EFH-HAPCs
- Flow regime characteristics compared to natural conditions
- Spawning success and recruitment of sensitive species
- Overall ecosystem structure and function indicators
