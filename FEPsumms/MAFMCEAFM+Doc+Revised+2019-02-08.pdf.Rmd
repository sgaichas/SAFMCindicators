This document is the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council's Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) Guidance Document. Here is a 500-word summary followed by the requested policy elements:

## Summary

The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council's EAFM Guidance Document, approved in 2016 and revised in 2019, represents a transitional approach to move from single-species fisheries management toward ecosystem-based management. The Council manages over 64 species across seven fishery management plans, coordinating with other management bodies including the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.

The document defines EAFM as recognizing biological, economic, social, and physical interactions among ecosystem components and attempting to manage fisheries to achieve optimum yield while considering these interactions. The overarching goal is to "manage for ecologically sustainable utilization of living marine resources while maintaining ecosystem productivity, structure, and function."

The guidance addresses four major ecosystem-related issues: forage species considerations, habitat conservation, climate change effects, and ecosystem-level interactions. The approach allows for evolutionary rather than revolutionary changes, enabling the Council to meet current Magnuson-Stevens Act requirements while gradually incorporating broader ecosystem considerations.

**Forage Species**: The Council recognizes that forage species play crucial ecological roles in energy transfer within marine food webs. They adopted policies to maintain adequate forage bases and implemented the Omnibus Unmanaged Forage Amendment in 2017, protecting over 50 previously unmanaged forage species by prohibiting new directed fisheries until adequate scientific assessment occurs.

**Habitat**: The document emphasizes habitat's fundamental role in marine ecosystem productivity. The Council committed to strengthening Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) designations from a multispecies perspective, demonstrating habitat's value to fisheries, and transitioning to landscape-level habitat descriptions. Key challenges include incorporating climate impacts on habitat and quantitatively linking habitat science to fishery outcomes.

**Climate Change**: The Northeast region experiences rapid environmental changes, with ocean temperatures increasing 1.3°C since 1854. The Council's climate initiatives include the Northeast Fisheries Climate Vulnerability Assessment, which identified ocean quahog as very highly vulnerable and three species as highly vulnerable to climate change. Most Council-managed species show high potential for distributional shifts.

**Ecosystem Interactions**: The document outlines a structured framework for incorporating species, fleet, habitat, and climate interactions into management through four steps: (1) prioritizing with risk assessment tools, (2) refining key management questions, (3) analyzing management procedures through Management Strategy Evaluation, and (4) implementing adaptive monitoring systems.

The Council acknowledges that implementing EAFM requires broader stakeholder engagement and enhanced integration of social and economic analyses. The guidance emphasizes using existing data sources and analytical tools while developing new approaches like multispecies models, conceptual models, and integrated ecosystem assessments.

This adaptive framework allows the Council to incorporate ecosystem science at a pace consistent with scientific development while maintaining sustainable fisheries management. The document serves as a "how-to" guide for transitioning to EAFM, with policies expected to evolve as new information and analytical tools become available.

## Stated Ecosystem Policies, Goals, and Objectives

### EAFM Definition & Goal
**Definition**: "An ecosystem approach to fishery management recognizes the biological, economic, social, and physical interactions among the components of ecosystems and attempts to manage fisheries to achieve optimum yield taking those interactions into account."

**Goal**: "To manage for ecologically sustainable utilization of living marine resources while maintaining ecosystem productivity, structure, and function."

### Forage Species

**Policy Statement**: 
"It shall be the policy of the Council to support the maintenance of an adequate forage base in the Mid-Atlantic to ensure ecosystem productivity, structure and function and to support sustainable fishing communities."

**Management Approaches**:
- Modifications to biological reference points (F<M, F=0.67M)
- Modifications to existing Council risk policy (reducing maximum tolerance for risk of overfishing)
- Trade-off analyses incorporating bio-socio-economic considerations
- Ecosystem Component designation for unmanaged forage species
- Exempted Fishing Permit requirements for new fisheries

**Performance Metrics**:
- Biomass Ecological Reference Points (BERP = 0.75 B0, 0.8 B0, 0.4 B0, 0.3 B0)
- Fishing Mortality Ecological Reference Points (F=M, F=0.87M, F=0.67M, FERP = 0.2-0.75 FMSY)

**Ecosystem Indicators**: 
Not specifically listed for forage species

### Habitat

**Policy Statements**:
1. "Strengthen EFH designations and consider essential from a multispecies/ecosystem perspective emphasizing the connectivity between species, life history stages, etc. and inshore and offshore habitats."
2. "Demonstrate and communicate the value of habitat to managed fisheries and quantitatively link habitat science and conservation to fishery outcomes."
3. "Encourage NMFS to conduct additional focused sampling in habitats at finer scales than has been historical practice."

**Management Approaches**:
- Ecosystem-level habitat descriptions and conservation
- Multi-species EFH designations
- Enhanced EFH consultation processes
- Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPCs) designation
- Integration with Integrated Ecosystem Assessment framework

### Climate Change and Variability

**Policy Statements**:
1. "Continue to work with NOAA on the implementation of the NMFS Climate Science Strategy in the Northeast region."
2. "Develop and evaluate approaches for MAFMC fisheries and their management to become more adaptive to change."
3. "Continue to advocate for, collaborate on, and support historical field and laboratory research to understand the effects of climate change on species managed by MAFMC and incorporate those results into assessment and management."

**Management Approaches**:
- Northeast Fisheries Climate Vulnerability Assessment implementation
- Temperature incorporation into stock assessment models
- Climate-ready checklist for stock assessments
