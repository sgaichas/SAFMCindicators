**Gulf of Mexico Fishery Ecosystem Plan Version 1.0 - Summary**

This 86-page Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP) was developed by LGL Ecological Research Associates for the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council in March 2022. It provides a structured framework to implement Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) in the Gulf of Mexico, addressing ecosystem-scale issues that transcend traditional single-stock management.

The plan adopts the "Next Generation FEP Loop" as its foundation but centers around Fishery Ecosystem Issues (FEIs) - specific, time-bounded management problems that can be addressed through Gulf Council action. FEIs serve as the operational units for implementing EBFM, operating on 1-3 year timeframes rather than the decade-long traditional FEP cycles.

The plan emphasizes three core components: 1) expanded institutional partnerships with state/federal agencies, academia, and NGOs; 2) a systematic FEI process with dedicated task forces; and 3) an expanded Cooperative Research Program modeled after successful Northeast programs. The framework incorporates extensive stakeholder engagement through visioning workshops, participatory modeling, and citizen science initiatives.

Key innovations include a "FEI Loop" that moves issues from identification through scoping, workplan development, implementation, management action, and evaluation. The plan recognizes Gulf subregions (particularly east vs. west of DeSoto Canyon) for targeted management approaches and includes mechanisms to address extra-jurisdictional issues like coastal development and pollution sources.

The document provides numerous decision-support tools including stakeholder mapping templates, indicator visualization dashboards, and criteria for FEI selection. It builds upon existing Gulf Council EBFM work while systematizing ecosystem considerations into routine management processes.

**Ecosystem Policies, Goals, and Objectives**

**Vision Statement (Proposed):**
Triple bottom line sustainability including:
- Environmental sustainability: healthy and resilient marine and coastal ecosystems supporting multi-species fisheries
- Economic sustainability: sustainable and resilient multi-species fisheries and dependent economies  
- Social sustainability: equitable resource access, thriving coastal communities, cultural preservation, sustainable employment

**FEP Goal:**
Institutionalize the FEP framework and structured planning process to incorporate and systemize EBFM implementation in the Gulf

**Objective 1:** Develop, review and adopt a systematic planning framework to select, prioritize and address FEIs that can inform management actions

**Management Approaches:**
- FEI Loop process (scoping → workplan → implementation → management action → evaluation)
- Ecosystem Technical Committee (ETC) vetting and review
- Task force empanelment for individual FEIs
- Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) for complex decisions
- Integration with existing Gulf Council processes

**Performance Metrics:**
- Number of FEIs completed annually
- Institutional progress tracking through standard monitoring templates
- Stakeholder engagement levels and diversity
- Management actions implemented from FEI recommendations

**Ecosystem Indicators:**
- Ecosystem Status Report indicators (updated every 5 years minimum)
- Single-stock and ecosystem-level parameters
- Sea surface temperature, wetland loss, sea-level rise trends
- Hypoxia and red tide event frequency/severity
- Coastal population changes
- Commercial and recreational revenue/landings
- IFQ share prices

**Objective 2:** Develop and institutionalize an expanded Cooperative Research Program, Research Institutional Partnerships and Extra-Jurisdictional Partnerships

**Management Approaches:**
- Study fleet of 50+ commercial vessels for data collection
- Near real-time sampling for emerging events (red tide, hypoxia, oil spills)
- Enhanced bio-sampling programs
- Cooperative environmental monitoring
- Citizen science programs with mobile apps
- Research partnerships with GCOOS, RESTORE, BOEM, academic institutions
- Extra-jurisdictional partnerships for addressing coastal water quality, nutrient loading

**Performance Metrics:**
- Number of cooperative research projects initiated and completed
- Volume and quality of data collected through study fleet
- Number of institutional partnerships established
- Stakeholder participation rates in research programs
- Research findings incorporated into management decisions

**Ecosystem Indicators:**
- Net Primary Productivity (NPP) measurements
- Zooplankton biomass trends
- Species richness and diversity indices
- Mean trophic level of commercial landings
- Bird relative abundance (brown pelican, magnificent frigatebird, etc.)
- Protected species nesting/stranding data
- Human population and coastal development metrics
- Environmental justice community indicators
- Recreational access point availability and usage

The plan includes a comprehensive list of 100+ potential indicators across climate drivers, physical/chemical pressures, habitat state, lower/upper trophic levels, ecosystem services, and human dimensions categories.
