	abstract = {Fifteen years in the making, this updated edition raises the high standard of Bigelow and Schroeder's 1953 reference by drawing from a much larger base of information. Thirty-eight experts in fisheries biology and ichthyology clearly distill the enormous amount of knowledge gained during the past fifty years, including distribution figures from thirty years of annual trawl surveys; food habit accounts from surveys of the stomach contents of more than 30,000 fishes; and egg distribution data from a survey exceeding 10,000 samples. The contributors update Bigelow and Schroeder's 1953 material while presenting a wealth of new information, including thirty-three additional species accounts. By adding fifty percent more material and focusing the volume on data, the editors address the needs of today's biologists, the commercial fishing industry, and marine enthusiasts, and ensure that Bigelow and Schroeder's Fishes of the Gulf of Maine, Third Edition, will become the standard work in the field for the next fifty years.},

We propose a state-space assessment model that is expanded to simultaneously treat environmental covariates as stochastic processes and estimate their effects on recruitment. We apply the model to southern New England yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) using data from the most recent benchmark assessment to evaluate evidence for effects of the mid-Atlantic cold pool and spawning stock biomass on recruitment. Based on Akaike’s information criterion, both the cold pool and spawning stock biomass were important predictors of recruitment and led to annual variation in estimated biomass reference points and associated yield. We also demonstrate the effect of the stochasticity of the mid-Atlantic cold pool on short-term forecasts of the stock size, biomass reference point, and stock status.},

	abstract = {Risk assessments quantify the probability of undesirable events along with their consequences. They are used to prioritize management interventions and assess tradeoffs, serving as an essential component of ecosystem-based management (EBM). A central objective of most risk assessments for conservation and management is to characterize uncertainty and impacts associated with one or more pressures of interest. Risk assessments have been used in marine resource management to help evaluate the risk of environmental, ecological, and anthropogenic pressures on species or habitats including for data-poor fisheries management (e.g., toxicity, probability of extinction, habitat alteration impacts). Traditionally, marine risk assessments focused on singular pressure-response relationships, but recent advancements have included use of risk assessments in an EBM context, providing a method for evaluating the cumulative impacts of multiple pressures on multiple ecosystem components. Here, we describe a conceptual framework for ecosystem risk assessment (ERA), highlighting its role in operationalizing EBM, with specific attention to ocean management considerations. This framework builds on the ecotoxicological and conservation literature on risk assessment and includes recent advances that focus on risks posed by fishing to marine ecosystems. We review how examples of ERAs from the United States fit into this framework, explore the variety of analytical approaches that have been used to conduct ERAs, and assess the challenges and data gaps that remain. This review discusses future prospects for ERAs as EBM decision-support tools, their expanded role in integrated ecosystem assessments, and the development of next-generation risk assessments for coupled natural–human systems.},

Increasing population pressure, declining fish stocks, and the attractiveness of natural amenities have all led to demographic shifts and economic transformations for many coastal communities dependent on fishing. This impact of “gentrification” on the commercial fishing industry often precipitates a move toward non-marine based economies that can displace local residents and their dependence on fishing as a way of life with resulting impacts to local economies and cultures. Drawing on the United States Census, National Marine Fisheries Service, and other secondary data sources, social indicators were developed for 2,948 coastal communities in the Eastern United States and Gulf Coast and were used to evaluate gentrification pressure in select communities highly engaged in fishing. We anticipate this methodology, when groundtruthed and then combined with time-series assessments, will lead to improvements in the assessment of fishing community vulnerability and resilience for the conduct of fisheries social impact assessments.},

This shift will require an adaptive response on the part of policy makers and fishery managers. In the U.S., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) established, in its fisheries agency (NOAA Fisheries), a set of social indicators of fishing community vulnerability and resilience to evaluate the impacts of changes in fishery management regimes. These indicators enhance the analytical capabilities within NOAA Fisheries for conducting fisheries social impact assessments and informing ecosystem-based fishery management. Building on the existing Community Social Vulnerability Indicators (CSVIs), new measures of climate change vulnerability are defined for the U.S. Eastern and Gulf coasts. These new indicators are used to assess the impact of sea level rise on critical commercial fishing infrastructure and the dependence of communities on species identified as vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Examples are provided in this article to demonstrate the utility of these new indicators to policy makers and the NOAA strategic goal for building resilient coastal communities that are environmentally and economically sustainable. Integration of CSVIs and the new climate change vulnerability indices highlight community needs for unique solutions in order to adapt to environmental and social changes and maintain their well-being.},

	abstract = {The ability to understand and ultimately predict ecosystem response to multiple pressures is paramount to successfully implement ecosystem-based management. Thresholds shifts and nonlinear patterns in ecosystem responses can be used to determine reference points that identify levels of a pressure that may drastically alter ecosystem status, which can inform management action. However, quantifying ecosystem reference points has proven elusive due in large part to the multi-dimensional nature of both ecosystem pressures and ecosystem responses. We used ecological indicators, synthetic measures of ecosystem status and functioning, to enumerate important ecosystem attributes and to reduce the complexity of the Northeast Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NES LME). Random forests were used to quantify the importance of four environmental and four anthropogenic pressure variables to the value of ecological indicators, and to quantify shifts in aggregate ecological indicator response along pressure gradients. Anthropogenic pressure variables were critical defining features and were able to predict an average of 8-13\% (up to 25-66\% for individual ecological indicators) of the variation in ecological indicator values, whereas environmental pressures were able to predict an average of 1-5 \% (up to 9-26\% for individual ecological indicators) of ecological indicator variation. Each pressure variable predicted a different suite of ecological indicator's variation and the shapes of ecological indicator responses along pressure gradients were generally nonlinear. Threshold shifts in ecosystem response to exploitation, the most important pressure variable, occurred when commercial landings were 20 and 60\% of total surveyed biomass. Although present, threshold shifts in ecosystem response to environmental pressures were much less important, which suggests that anthropogenic pressures have significantly altered the ecosystem structure and functioning of the NES LME. Gradient response curves provide ecologically informed transformations of pressure variables to explain patterns of ecosystem structure and functioning. By concurrently identifying thresholds for a suite of ecological indicator responses to multiple pressures, we demonstrate that ecosystem reference points can be evaluated and used to support ecosystem-based management.},

	abstract = {The application of ecosystem considerations, and in particular ecosystem report cards, in federal groundfish fisheries management in Alaska can be described as an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). Ecosystem information is provided to managers to establish an ecosystem context within which deliberations of fisheries quota occur. Our goal is to make the case for the need for qualitative ecosystem assessments in EAFM, specifically that qualitative synthesis has advantages worthy to keep a permanent place at the fisheries management table. These advantages include flexibility and speed in responding to and synthesizing new information from a variety of sources. First, we use the development of indicator-based ecosystem report cards as an example of adapting ecosystem information to management needs. Second, we review lessons learned and provide suggestions for best practices for applying EAFM to large and diverse fisheries in multiple marine ecosystems. Adapting ecosystem indicator information to better suit the needs of fisheries managers resulted in succinct report cards that summarize ecosystem trends, complementing more detailed ecosystem information to provide context for EAFM. There were several lessons learned in the process of developing the ecosystem report cards. The selection of indicators for each region was influenced by geography, the extent of scientific knowledge/data, and the particular expertise of the selection teams. Optimizing the opportunity to qualitatively incorporate ecosystem information into management decisions requires a good understanding of the management system in question. We found that frequent dialogue with managers and other stakeholders leads to adaptive products. We believe that there will always be a need for qualitative ecosystem assessment because it allows for rapid incorporation of new ideas and data and unexpected events. As we build modelling and predictive capacity, we will still need qualitative synthesis to capture events outside the bounds of current models and to detect impacts of the unexpected.},

Emphasizing the need to link indicators to management objectives, indicators from the literature are grouped into four categories, relating to the immediate fisheries resource base (single-species and multispecies indicators) and the wider ecosystem (habitat structure and ecosystem functioning). The usefulness of these indicators is assessed along three dimensions of acceptability among stakeholders, observability, and relation to fisheries management using a traffic light approach. The top ranking indicators are highlighted as a generally good start for any particular fishery management case. It is, however, argued that, even with similar management objectives, indicators need to be specific to both ecosystems and the institutional set-up if they are to be effective for management, and that indicators may consequently differ considerably between individual management applications.},

	abstract = {Climate change and decadal variability are impacting marine fish and invertebrate species worldwide and these impacts will continue for the foreseeable future. Quantitative approaches have been developed to examine climate impacts on productivity, abundance, and distribution of various marine fish and invertebrate species. However, it is difficult to apply these approaches to large numbers of species owing to the lack of mechanistic understanding sufficient for quantitative analyses, as well as the lack of scientific infrastructure to support these more detailed studies. Vulnerability assessments provide a framework for evaluating climate impacts over a broad range of species with existing information. These methods combine the exposure of a species to a stressor (climate change and decadal variability) and the sensitivity of species to the stressor. These two components are then combined to estimate an overall vulnerability. Quantitative data are used when available, but qualitative information and expert opinion are used when quantitative data is lacking. Here we conduct a climate vulnerability assessment on 82 fish and invertebrate species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf including exploited, forage, and protected species. We define climate vulnerability as the extent to which abundance or productivity of a species in the region could be impacted by climate change and decadal variability. We find that the overall climate vulnerability is high to very high for approximately half the species assessed; diadromous and benthic invertebrate species exhibit the greatest vulnerability. In addition, the majority of species included in the assessment have a high potential for a change in distribution in response to projected changes in climate. Negative effects of climate change are expected for approximately half of the species assessed, but some species are expected to be positively affected (e.g., increase in productivity or move into the region). These results will inform research and management activities related to understanding and adapting marine fisheries management and conservation to climate change and decadal variability.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a risk table to facilitate incorporation of additional information into the fisheries stock assessment and management process. The risk table is designed to evaluate unanticipated ecosystem and environmental impacts on marine resources that may require a rapid management response. The risk table is a standardized framework to document concerns about the assessment model, population dynamics, and the ecosystem/environment that are not explicitly addressed within the stock assessment model. A scoring procedure is used to evaluate the severity of the concern. These concerns can then be evaluated in support for or against a reduction from the maximum Acceptable Biological Catch while providing reviewers and stakeholders transparent documentation of the concerns. The risk table was applied successfully to several stocks on a trial basis during the 2018 groundfish assessment cycle for the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, and will be used for all full groundfish assessments in 2019. Rapid changes in climate are likely for Alaska marine ecosystems in coming decades, and these changes are not entirely predicable. Therefore, we avocate that the risk table approach should be included in the suite of management tools used to address the effects of climate change on Alaska marine resources.},

	abstract = {Integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs) compile and use indicators, risk assessments, and other analyses to address regional policy needs at varying spatial scales. Although approaches to implementing IEAs are context-specific, challenges in data acquisition, management, processing, analysis, and communication are universal. By embracing open science, in which scientific data, methods, and products are made publicly accessible, along with the ever-expanding tools facilitating open science, IEA practitioners will be better equipped to address these challenges. Here, we provide a snapshot of the state of open science practices in IEAs on-going across the United States. We show that open science has improved the flexibility, reproducibility, and efficiency of the scientific workflows within the IEA framework. Although the initial time investment necessary for developing open science workflows may appear daunting, we show that the subsequent returns provided by the efficient and transparent development of IEA products are worth the effort. By improving the implementation of IEAs, open science tools and principals have the potential to further Ecosystem Based Management (EBM) worldwide.},

	abstract = {The well-documented value of marine fisheries is threatened by overfishing. Management typically focuses on target populations but lacks effective tools to document or restrain overexploitation of marine ecosystems. Here, we present three indices and accompanying thresholds to detect and delineate ecosystem overfishing (EOF): the Fogarty, Friedland, and Ryther indices. These are based on widely available and readily interpreted catch and satellite data that link fisheries landings to primary production using known limits of trophic transfer efficiency. We propose theoretically and empirically based thresholds for each of those indices; with these criteria, several ecosystems are fished sustainably, but nearly 40 to 50\% of tropical and temperate ecosystems exceed even extreme thresholds. Applying these criteria to global fisheries data results in strong evidence for two specific instances of EOF, increases in both pressure on tropical fish and a climate-mediated polar shift. Here, we show that these two patterns represent evidence for global EOF.
Newly derived thresholds show that about half the world’s marine ecosystems are experiencing “ecosystem” overfishing.

	abstract = {Although many countries have formally committed to Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management (EBFM), actual progress towards these goals has been slow. This paper presents two independent case studies that have combined strategic advice from ecosystem modelling with the tactical advice of single-species assessment models to provide practical ecosystem-based management advice. With this approach, stock status, reference points, and initial target F are computed from a single-species model, then an ecosystem model rescales the target F according to ecosystem indicators without crossing pre-calculated single-species precautionary limits. Finally, the single-species model computes the quota advice from the rescaled target F, termed here Feco. Such a methodology incorporates both the detailed population reconstructions of the single-species model and the broader ecosystem perspective from ecosystem-based modelling, and fits into existing management schemes. The advocated method has arisen from independent work on EBFM in two international fisheries management systems: 1) Atlantic menhaden in the United States and 2) the multi species fisheries of the Irish Sea, in the Celtic Seas ecoregion. In the Atlantic menhaden example, the objective was to develop ecological reference points that account for the effect of menhaden harvest on predator populations and the tradeoffs associated with forage fish management. In the Irish Sea, the objective was to account for ecosystem variability when setting quotas for the individual target species. These two exercises were aimed at different management needs, but both arrived at a process of adjusting the target F used within the current single-species management. Although the approach has limitations, it represents a practical step towards EBFM, which can be adapted to a range of ecosystem objectives and applied within current management systems.},

Fisheries managers face the challenge of maintaining or restoring sustainability for individual living resources which are affected by both ecological and economic interactions with other species, through processes like predation and fishing fleet interactions. These species interactions are further complicated by interactions with habitats that are changing due to both human activities and climate change. Often, fishery management systems designed to promote sustainability of individual resources have few tools or processes that also address interactions between species, fleets, habitat, and climate. Here, we review existing and potential fishery assessment and management information and tools, and we develop a potential framework for addressing interactions in management at the request of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council. The structured framework can be used to first prioritize interactions, second specify key questions regarding high priority interactions, and third tailor appropriate analyses to address them. The primary tools for the initial steps in the framework are risk assessment and Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). Finally, implemented management would be evaluated to ensure that objectives are being met, or to adjust measures as conditions change. In the final section, we outline an example to illustrate how a structured decision making process within the framework could work.},

	abstract = {Fishery managers worldwide are evaluating methods for incorporating climate, habitat, ecological, social, and economic factors into current operations in order to implement Ecosystem Approaches to Fishery Management (EAFM). While this can seem overwhelming, it is possible to take practical steps towards EAFM implementation that make use of existing information and provide managers with valuable strategic advice. Here, we describe the process used by the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) to develop an ecosystem-level risk assessment, the initial step proposed in their recently adopted EAFM guidance document. The Council first defined five types of Risk Elements (ecological, economic, social, food production, management) and identified which management objectives aligned with each element. Based on an existing ecosystem status report for the region and other existing sources (including expert opinion), potential ecological, social, economic, and management indicators were identified for each risk element. Finally, low, low-moderate, moderate-high, and high risk criteria were defined for each indicator, and the indicator data were used to score each risk element using the criteria. The ultimate outcome is a ranked risk assessment in order to focus on the highest risk issues for further evaluation and mitigation. The risk assessment highlights certain species and certain management issues as posing higher cumulative risks to meeting Council management objectives when considering a broad range of ecological, social, and economic factors. Tabular color coded summaries of risk assessment results will be used by the Council to prioritize further EAFM analyses as well as research plans over the coming five years. As ecosystem reporting and operational EAFM continue to evolve in future years, the Council foresees integrating these efforts so that ecosystem indicators are refined to meet the needs of fishery managers in identifying and managing risks to achieving ecological, social, and economic fishery objectives. Overall, ecosystem indicator-based risk assessment is a method that can be adapted to a wide range of resource management systems and available information, and therefore represent a promising way forward in the implementation of EAFM.},

Defining trends and thresholds in responses of ecological indicators to fishing and environmental pressures. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 755–767. Both fishing and environmental forces can influence the structure of marine ecosystems. To further understand marine ecosystems and to implement ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), an evaluation of ecosystem indicators is warranted. In this context, it is particularly important to identify thresholds where fishing and environmental pressures significantly influence ecological indicators. We empirically determined numerical values of environmental forces and fishing pressure that significantly altered the response of ecological indicators for the Northeast Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem. Generalized additive models predicted a non-linear relationship for each pressure–response pairing. With this smoother, 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for estimated first and second derivatives for each relationship were determined via parametric bootstrap. A significant trend or threshold was noted when the CI for the first or second derivative was greater or less than zero, delineating the level at which pressure variables influence the rate and direction of ecosystem indicator responses. We identify reference levels where environmental forces and fishing pressure result in ecosystem change by collectively examining the responses of multiple ecological indicators. Individual indicators showed unique responses to pressures, however, similar values for the pressures were associated with significant changes for multiple indicators. These reference levels establish a foundation for implementation of EBFM.},

We used Management Strategy Evaluation to test the performance of control rules that used ecological indicators to adjust the advice from single-species stock assessments, using the Georges Bank finfish fishery as a case study. We compare the performance of control rules that used ecological indicators to that of single-species FMSY control rules when the system dynamics were governed by the same multispecies population model. Control rules that used indicator-based reference points were able to perform better against catch and biodiversity objectives than when harvests were based on single-species advice alone. Indicators and values for reference points associated with good performance varied depending on the management objective. We quantified tradeoffs between total catch, biodiversity, and interannual variability in catch, noting that it was possible in some instances to achieve higher than average biodiversity while maintaining high catches using indicator-based control rules. While improved performance was noted using ecological indicators, outcomes were variable, and the gains in performance obtained may be similar to alternative methods of implementing precaution in single-species fishery control rules.},

Threshold values in ecosystem indicators have been demonstrated to provide insight for characterizing change points in marine ecosystems and suggested as reference points for EBFM. We used a guild based multispecies simulation model of the Georges Bank finfish community to quantify tradeoffs and changes among values for proposed ecological indicators given alternative fishing scenarios, and tested the performance of indicator-based approaches for setting system ceilings on annual catches. Values for ecosystem indicators were sensitive to the exploitation rates on guilds, with total biomass of the community being most sensitive to groundfish exploitation rate. Setting ceilings on system-wide annual catches was successful in constraining values for indicators and revealed levels of system catch associated with indicator change. Community composition indicators showed catch thresholds lower than provided by the total biomass indicator. Ceilings based on community composition indicators more frequently resulted in higher yields and fewer species being overfished than when ceilings were set using total biomass or when no ceiling was in place. Simulations demonstrated that threshold values in ecosystem indicators could be used to determine reference points in an EBFM context. The broad ranges for threshold values obtained demonstrates the sensitivity of such methods to exploitation history, underscoring the need to both incorporate expert knowledge and relate reference point determination to management objectives.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem-based management (EBM) in marine ecosystems considers impacts caused by complex interactions between environmental and anthropogenic pressures (i.e. oceanographic, climatic, socio-economic) and marine communities. EBM depends, in part, on ecological indicators that facilitate understanding of inherent properties and the dynamics of pressures within marine communities. Thresholds of ecological indicators delineate ecosystem status because they represent points at which a small increase in one or many pressure variables results in an abrupt change of ecosystem responses. The difficulty in developing appropriate thresholds and reference points for EBM lies in the multidimensionality of both the ecosystem responses and the pressures impacting the ecosystem. Here, we develop thresholds using gradient forest for a suite of ecological indicators in response to multiple pressures that convey ecosystem status for large marine ecosystems from the US Pacific, Atlantic, sub-Arctic, and Gulf of Mexico. We detected these thresholds of ecological indicators based on multiple pressures. Commercial fisheries landings above approximately 2-4.5 t km-2 and fisheries exploitation above 20-40\% of the total estimated biomass (of invertebrates and fish) of the ecosystem resulted in a change in the direction of ecosystem structure and functioning in the ecosystems examined. Our comparative findings reveal common trends in ecosystem thresholds along pressure gradients and also indicate that thresholds of ecological indicators are useful tools for comparing the impacts of environmental and anthropogenic pressures across multiple ecosystems. These critical points can be used to inform the development of EBM decision criteria.},

That focus has intensified with shifting environmental conditions associated with accelerating climate change. The U.S. Northeast Shelf (NES) is a well-studied continental shelf marine ecosystem that is among the more rapidly warming marine systems worldwide. Furthermore, many constituent species have experienced significant distributional shifts. However, the system response of the NES to climate change goes beyond simple shifts in species distribution. The fish and macroinvertebrate communities of the NES have increased in species diversity and overall productivity in recent decades, despite no significant decline in fishing pressure. Species distribution models constructed using random forest classification and regression trees were fit for the dominant species in the system. Over time, the areal distribution of occupancy habitat has increased for approximately 80\% of the modeled taxa, suggesting most species have significantly increased their range and niche space. These niche spaces were analyzed to determine the area of niche overlap between species pairs. For the vast majority of species pairs, interaction has increased over time suggesting greater niche overlap and the increased probability for more intense species interactions, such as between competitors or predators and prey. Furthermore, the species taxonomic composition and size structure indicate a potential tropicalization of the fish community. The system and community changes are consistent with the view that the NES may be transitioning from a cold temperate or boreal ecoregion to one more consistent with the composition of a warm temperate or Carolinian system.},

	abstract = {The oceans are changing more rapidly than ever before. Unprecedented climatic variability is interacting with unmistakable long-term trends, all against a backdrop of intensifying human activities. What remains unclear, however, is how to evaluate whether conditions have changed sufficiently to provoke major responses of species, habitats, and communities. We developed a framework based on multimodel inference to define ecosystem-based thresholds for human and environmental pressures in the California Current marine ecosystem. To demonstrate how to apply the framework, we explored two decades of data using gradient forest and generalized additive model analyses, screening for nonlinearities and potential threshold responses of ecosystem states (n = 9) across environmental (n = 6) and human (n = 10) pressures. These analyses identified the existence of threshold responses of five ecosystem states to four environmental and two human pressures. Both methods agreed on threshold relationships in two cases: (1) the winter copepod anomaly and habitat modification, and (2) sea lion pup production and the summer mode of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Considered collectively, however, these alternative analytical approaches imply that as many as five of the nine ecosystem states may exhibit threshold changes in response to negative PDO values in the summer (copepods, scavengers, groundfish, and marine mammals). This result is consistent with the idea that the influence of the PDO extends across multiple trophic levels, but extends current knowledge by defining the nonlinear nature of these responses. This research provides a new way to interpret changes in the intensities of human and environmental pressures as they relate to the ecological integrity of the California Current ecosystem. These insights can be used to make more informed assessments of when and under what conditions intervention, preparation, and mitigation may enhance progress toward ecosystem-based management goals.},

A stakeholder driven management  strategy evaluation (MSE) was conducted that incorporated a broad range  of objectives. The MSE process was completed within one year. Constant  catch, conditional constant catch, and a biomass-based (BB) HCR with a  15\% restriction on the interannual change in the quota could achieve  more stable yields than BB HCRs without such restrictions, but could not  attain as high of yields and resulted in more negative outcomes for  terns (a herring predator). A similar range of performance could be  achieved by applying a BB HCR annually, every three years, or every five  years. Predators (i.e., dogfish, tuna, and terns) were generally  insensitive to the range of HCRs. While median net revenues were  sensitive to some HCRs, most HCRs produced a stable equilibrium of net revenue. In order to meet  management needs, some aspects of the simulations were less than might  be considered scientifically ideal, but using models of intermediate  complexity formed a foundation for future improvements.},

Through the course of 2019, the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council developed a conceptual model of ecosystem linkages and risks for summer flounder, a species of recreational and commercial fisheries importance. The proximal aim of the model was to develop a list of integrated management questions that could be refined and addressed through a future quantitative management strategy evaluation. As such, this conceptual model served as a scoping tool. However, the true value of the conceptual model lays elsewhere: familiarizing resource managers historically focused on single-species management with the potential utility of an ecosystem approach to management. This paper details the goals and development of the conceptual model and situates this process in the broader context of best practices for collaborative open science and scientific reproducibility. Further, it highlights a successful path by which the shift towards ecosystem-based management can be actuated.},

First, a conceptual life history approach is used to generate life-stage-specific and spatio-temporally specific mechanistic hypotheses regarding oceanographic variables that likely influence survival at each life stage. Seven life history stages are considered, from female spawner condition through benthic recruitment as observed in the Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (age-2 fish). The study area encompasses the region from 40 to 48°N in the California Current Ecosystem. Hypotheses are tested using output from a regional ocean reanalysis model outputs and model selection techniques. Four oceanographic variables explained 73\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by estimates based exclusively on the spawning stock size. Recruitment deviations were (a) positively correlated with degree days during the female precondition period, (b) positively correlated with mixed-layer depth during the egg stage, (c) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the larval stage, and (d) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the benthic juvenile stage. While multiple mechanisms likely affect petrale sole recruitment at different points during their life history, the strength of the relationship is promising for stock assessment and integrated ecosystem assessment applications.},

	abstract = {Oceanographic processes and ecological interactions can strongly influence recruitment success in marine fishes. Here, we develop an environmental index of sablefish recruitment with the goal of elucidating recruitment-environment relationships and informing stock assessment. We start with a conceptual life-history model for sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria on the US west coast to generate stage- and spatio-temporally-specific hypotheses regarding the oceanographic and biological variables likely influencing sablefish recruitment. Our model includes seven stages from pre-spawn female condition through benthic recruitment (age-0 fish) for the northern portion of the west coast U.S. sablefish stock (40°N–50°N). We then fit linear models and use model comparison to select predictors. We use residuals from the stock-recruitment relationship in the 2015 sablefish assessment as the dependent variable (thus removing the effect of spawning stock biomass). Predictor variables were drawn primarily from ROMS model outputs for the California Current Ecosystem. We also include indices of prey and predator abundance and freshwater input. Five variables explained 57\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by the stock-recruitment relationship in the sablefish assessment. Recruitment deviations were positively correlated with (i) colder conditions during the spawner preconditioning period, (ii) warmer water temperatures during the egg stage, (iii) stronger cross-shelf transport to near-shore nursery habitats during the egg stage, (iv) stronger long-shore transport to the north during the yolk-sac stage, and (v) cold surface water temperatures during the larval stage. This result suggests that multiple mechanisms likely affect sablefish recruitment at different points in their life history.},

These impacts often exacerbate the anthropogenic stressors that habitats face, particularly in the coastal environment. We conducted a climate vulnerability assessment of 52 marine, estuarine, and riverine habitats in the Northeast U.S. to develop an ecosystem-scale understanding of the impact of climate change on these habitats. The trait-based assessment considers the overall vulnerability of a habitat to climate change to be a function of two main components, sensitivity and exposure, and relies on a process of expert elicitation. The climate vulnerability ranks ranged from low to very high, with living habitats identified as the most vulnerable. Over half of the habitats examined in this study are expected to be impacted negatively by climate change, while four habitats are expected to have positive effects. Coastal habitats were also identified as highly vulnerable, in part due to the influence of non-climate anthropogenic stressors. The results of this assessment provide regional managers and scientists with a tool to inform habitat conservation, restoration, and research priorities, fisheries and protected species management, and coastal and ocean planning.},

	abstract = {Resource managers worldwide are being asked to consider the ecosystem while making management decisions. Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) provides a flexible framework for addressing ecosystem considerations in decision making. The US Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) adapted the IEA approach and implemented a structured decision framework to address species, fleet, habitat, and climate interactions as part of their Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) in 2016. The Council’s EAFM decision framework first uses risk assessment to prioritize fishery-ecosystem interactions for consideration. The Council’s 2017 EAFM risk assessment identified a range of ecological, social, and management objectives or risk elements. Development of a conceptual model to identify key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery is the second step in the framework. The Council identified summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) as a high-risk fishery and finalized an EAFM conceptual model that considers high-risk factors and ecosystem elements in 2019. The Council used the conceptual model to identify three priority summer flounder management questions (recreational data uncertainty, recreational discards, and distribution shifts) to be considered for quantitative management strategy evaluation, the third step in the EAFM framework and set to begin in 2020. Finally, as strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or other priorities identified in the risk assessment can be addressed. The Council’s rapid progress in implementing EAFM resulted from an extensive, positive, and collaborative process between managers, stakeholders, and scientists. Collaboration helps build trust and buy-in from all participants and is essential to IEA and to the success of EAFM.},

Here, we analyzed stock assessment output and survey data to test for regimes in the recruitment success of 18 commercially important marine species over a 29 yr timespan. We then tested whether recruitment regimes coincide with regimes in the zooplankton community, and whether the abundance of large spawners could explain the patterns in recruitment. We found evidence for 3 decadal-scale recruitment regimes: low recruitment success in the 1980s, high success in the 1990s, and a return to low recruitment success in the 2000s. This general pattern was found in all datasets of recruitment. The abundance of large spawners did not appear to be a broad-scale driver of recruitment success; however, recruitment regimes coincided with regimes in copepod abundance and size structure.},

	abstract = {The rapid changes observed in many marine ecosystems that support fisheries pose a challenge to stock assessment and management predicated on time-invariant productivity and considering species in isolation. In single-species assessments, two main approaches have been used to account for productivity changes: allowing biological parameters to vary stochastically over time (empirical), or explicitly linking population processes such as recruitment (R) or natural mortality (M) to environmental covariates (mechanistic). Here, we describe the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM) framework and software package, which combines these two approaches. WHAM can estimate time- and age-varying random effects on annual transitions in numbers at age (NAA), M, and selectivity, as well as fit environmental time-series with process and observation errors, missing data, and nonlinear links to R and M. WHAM can also be configured as a traditional statistical catch-at-age (SCAA) model in order to easily bridge from status quo models and test them against models with state-space and environmental effects, all within a single framework. We fit models with and without (independent or autocorrelated) random effects on NAA, M, and selectivity to data from five stocks with a broad range of life history, fishing pressure, number of ages, and time-series length. Models that included random effects performed well across stocks and processes, especially random effects models with a two dimensional (2D) first-order autoregressive, AR(1), covariance structure over age and year. We conducted simulation tests and found negligible or no bias in estimation of important assessment outputs (SSB, F, stock status, and catch) when the operating and estimation models matched. However, bias in SSB and F was often non-trivial when the estimation model was less complex than the operating model, especially when models without random effects were fit to data simulated from models with random effects. Bias of the variance and correlation parameters controlling random effects was also negligible or slightly negative as expected. Our results suggest that WHAM can be a useful tool for stock assessment when environmental effects on R or M, or stochastic variation in NAA transitions, M, or selectivity are of interest. In the U.S. Northeast, where the productivity of several groundfish stocks has declined, conducting assessments in WHAM with time-varying processes via random effects or environment-productivity links may account for these trends and potentially reduce retrospective bias.},

	abstract = {Logbook data from commercial fisheries are a vital component in the machinery of management, including tracking the volume of catches and allocating catch spatially. At the same time, logbooks can provide a unique window into the ecological and sociological conditions in marine fisheries, where fishermen interact with marine species and environments frequently and broadly. Traditional logbooks, however, often are not sufficiently standardized (when personal logs), or lack the detail (when regulatory documents) required to adequately understand fisheries ecosystems. The Study Fleet program, operated by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center’s Cooperative Research Branch, was developed to address these shortfalls by engaging members of the fishing industry in collecting high-resolution catch, effort, and environmental data using electronic logbooks. Since its inception, the Study Fleet has expanded from a small project focused on collecting detailed catch information from the New England multispecies groundfish fishery to a program with a wider scope encompassing a variety of fisheries, gears, and environmental parameters from North Carolina to Maine U.S. Over the years, a number of lessons have been learned about recruiting and supporting industry partners, managing the data, evolving technical specifications, and the challenges associated with analyzing and applying self-reported fisheries data. Here we describe the current state of the program and provide summaries of the Study Fleet program operations and outcomes from 2007-2020, with an eye towards successes, challenges, and applicability of the approach in other regions. We suggest other reference fleet programs, as well as other developing fishery dependent data collections (e.g., electronic monitoring programs), develop detailed roadmaps for each data collection to keep participants engaged as collaborators, target specific fisheries to keep resources from being stretched too thin, and partner with data users early. Additionally, we suggest programs invest in the long-term participation of individual fishermen, carefully weigh the pros and cons of involvement in regulatory reporting, and plan data products and applications well in advance to ensure that the sampling scheme and granularity of the data meet the needs of stock assessment, ecosystem, and oceanographic scientists.},

	abstract = {Long-term mechanistic research and monitoring provides integral science support for ecosystem-based management (EBM) of resources, activities and services. Decades of oceanographic and ecological research by Bill Peterson and colleagues along the Newport Hydrographic Line (NH Line) provides essential context for understanding and managing Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and other marine resources in the California Current ecosystem. This research program helped federal scientists convey the significance of the northeast Pacific marine heatwave (2013–2016) to fisheries managers and stakeholders. Particularly illustrative were shifts in the composition of the copepod community, which reflected feeding conditions for Pacific salmon and other consumers. We identify six traits of the dataset produced by Peterson and colleagues that have made it especially valuable for informing management: (i) it has generated robust ecosystem indicators; (ii) it is long-term; (iii) it is associated with meaningful ecological mechanisms; (iv) it relates to ecosystem components of high societal value; (v) it can represent processes and lags at meaningful temporal scales; and (vi) it is part of a broader, integrative science effort. This research effort underscores the importance of developing and sustaining long-term mechanistic research and monitoring along the U.S. West Coast and elsewhere in the world.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, numerous ecosystem surveys and process studies have emerged to monitor and assess the large marine ecosystems of Alaska. Several regional collaborative integrated ecosystem research projects (IERPs) were conducted to gain understanding of fish population fluctuations in relation to the surrounding environment. The Gulf of Alaska (GOA) IERP is one example of such an effort. Products of this program include a suite of in situ observations from fully integrated ecosystem surveys, laboratory experiments of physical thresholds for fish condition, and high-resolution oceanographic, planktonic, and habitat distribution models. When coupled, the synthesis products of this program can be utilized to understand system connectivity and highlight the primary ecosystem drivers of the GOA. Much of this information was included in annual GOA ecosystem status reports through individual indicator contributions. However, assimilation of these data into single-species stock assessments has remained limited. We provide a clear and direct avenue for including the products of these IERPs through the new ecosystem and socioeconomic profile (ESP) framework that identifies mechanistic relationships and tests ecosystem linkages within the stock assessment process. We present a case study using a data synthesis of the five commercially and ecologically valuable focal species of the GOAIERP (sablefish, pollock, Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, and Pacific ocean perch). Information was organized along the categories of distribution, phenology, and condition by life history stage to develop life history narratives for each species. These narratives identified critical ecosystem processes that could impact survival of each species. We then used habitat distribution models, seasonal phenology, and energy allocation strategies to sequentially reduce two gridded temperature datasets to reflect the life experience of the stock. This method essentially aligns ecosystem information at a spatial and temporal scale relevant to a stock and creates informed indicators that could then be related to a stock assessment parameter of interest, such as recruitment. Informed temperature indicators differed in magnitude and variability when compared to non-informed indicators and demonstrating species and stage-specific thermal preferences. The difference between the informed indicators and the non-informed indicators can also highlight thresholds and trends in habitat preference that could be further investigated with targeted process studies or laboratory experiments. The coordinated nature of the IERP allowed for the creation of these informed indicators that would not be possible with the results of any one process study. Both the stock-specific narratives and the informed indicators can be included into the ESPs for further monitoring and development. This integration ensures that the identified ecosystem linkages are evaluated concurrently with the stock assessment and ultimately transferred to fishery managers in an efficient and effective format for informing management decisions.},

We surveyed stock assessment scientists to a) identify the methods commonly used to quantify uncertainty, b) describe how method use has changed over time, c) investigate the factors that influence which methods are used, and d) characterize how scientific uncertainty is presented to fisheries managers. We found that scientific uncertainty is being quantified and included in scientific advice across multiple fishery management systems. Frequentist approaches for quantifying uncertainty are used more broadly than Bayesian approaches, and the survey did not detect this changing over time. Time restrictions and methodology requests during the scientific review process were commonly reported as factors influencing the use of uncertainty methods. Uncertainty in estimates of management targets (e.g., fishing mortality or biomass), projections, and catch limits were the quantities most frequently included in the scientific advice presented to fisheries managers. Methods for quantifying uncertainty and their incorporation into management advice are quickly advancing, and our approaches for reviewing progress towards clearly and explicitly communicating the sources, treatment, and impacts of uncertainty in management processes must keep pace.},

	abstract = {The impact of warming on fisheries resources on the Northeast U.S. Shelf is increasingly apparent through shifts in species distribution and productivity changes of economically and culturally important stocks, such as groundfish. Ignoring such impacts can potentially lead to problems with stock assessment performance and effectiveness of fisheries management decisions. Retrospective patterns (i.e., inconsistency of recent estimates after adding another year of data) currently present a large source of uncertainty in the classification of stock status and determination of catch advice for New England groundfish. We evaluated the impact of ignoring historical climate impacts on assessment performance and the resulting management for New England groundfish. We utilized a management strategy evaluation framework to simulate the impacts of climate change on recruitment, natural mortality, and growth for New England groundfish, emulate stock assessment mis­ specifications, and evaluate the performance of harvest control rules. Three harvest control rules were evaluated: ramped, step in advised fishing mortality (i.e., fishing mortality reduces from 75\% FMSY to 70\% FMSY when biomass decreases below the biomass threshold) and a constrained ramped harvest control rule (i.e., the target advised catch cannot vary more than 20\% from the previous year’s catch). Results suggest tradeoffs among control rules, but addressing stock assessment bias resulting from misspecifications may be more important than identifying an optimal harvest control rule for meeting management objectives. Failure to account for changes in stock dynamics from climate change resulted in adverse effects on the performance of New England groundfish assessment and management, but the magnitude of impact varied by harvest control rule. Retrospective patterns caused unintended overfishing because of management actions derived from misperceptions of stock status. Our research shows how management strategy evaluation can be used to test the robustness of harvest control rules to climate change impacts on stock dynamics.},

While ecological regime shifts are well studied, social regime shifts within SESs are underexplored. Socioeconomic indicators were used to identify thresholds and trends in fisheries and coastal employment for six marine SESs around the U.S. These study sites represent coastal regions delineated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for which periodic monitoring and data collection occur. We first used Generalized Additive Modeling to identify periods of change, then linked them to potential regional and national drivers. Social outcomes were ranked using composite social and environmental indices for each region, constructed using Data Envelopment Analysis. Technological innovation and national regulatory changes (e.g., Magnuson Stevens Act) co-occurred with detected nationwide shifts in fisheries productivity, while engagement in specific fisheries determined local regional shifts. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the complementary threshold analysis and outcome ranking methods in identifying regimes and assessing performance. Together, they provide management information and insight into possibilities for preventing unfavorable shifts and to assess society’s ability to adapt to those shifts.},

Implementation has progressed through large-scale comprehensive ecosystem status reports; however, integrating ecosystem research within the stock assessment process remains elusive. Primary obstacles include the lack of a consistent approach to including ecosystem and socioeconomic information into a stock assessment model and how to test its reliability for identifying future change. We introduce a methodology and reporting framework termed the Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profile (ESP) to overcome these obstacles. The ESP facilitates the integration of ecosystem and socioeconomic factors within the stock assessment process through four steps that culminate in a focused, succinct, and meaningful communication of drivers for a given stock. The first ESP was produced for Alaska sablefish and we provide the general process to implement the ESP framework using results from the sablefish ESP. We conducted a data synthesis that allowed for the framework to be applied across multiple regions and stocks. ESPs are an efficient testing ground for developing ecosystem-linked stock assessments and provide a set of reporting tools that can be tailored to a variety of audiences in order to effectively merge the ecosystem, socioeconomic, and stock assessment disciplines.},

Our cross ecoregion analysis shows that regime shifts in different ecoregions often exhibited very distinct characteristics, emphasizing more granular fluctuations in NES plankton communities relative to previous work. Shifts early in the time series generally reflected an increase in abundance levels. The response of zooplankton abundance within fall communities was more similar among ecoregions than for spring communities. The Gulf of Maine exhibited highly distinct patterns from other ecoregions, with regime shifts identified in the early 1980s, early 2000s, and mid-2000s for spring communities. Regime shifts were identified in the early to mid-1990s for the NES, Georges Bank, and the Mid-Atlantic Bight ecoregions, while the fall communities experienced shifts in the early 1990s and late 1980s for the NES and Georges Bank, but in the late 1990s in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. A constrained correspondence analysis of zooplankton community against local and basin-scale climatological indices suggests that water temperature, stratification, and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) were the predominant factors in driving the zooplankton community composition.},

However, these multi-attribute control rules will be less straightforward than those applied typically in single-species management, and may represent a gradient rather than binary decision criteria. Some ecosystem-based decision criteria are suggested, based on indicators empirically derived from the Georges Bank, Gulf of Maine ecosystem.

Assessing the state needs to be informed by thresholds above which state is defined as “good” for both the quality that defines good state, and the extent of the habitat that needs to be in such a quality. Operationalizing such thresholds has been carried out using a wide variety of approaches, with, often, haphazard and subjective outcomes. Here, we review approaches for setting “good-state” thresholds and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses for application to marine seabed ecosystems. Only two approaches defined a current ecologically meaningful good state and estimated thresholds quantitatively from data, while two other approaches (“avoid collapse” and “allow recovery”) would result in a state that could recover to good in the future. Other methods were subjective in the choice of threshold or based on statistically detectable thresholds rather than thresholds between good and not good or degraded state. We argue that the most objective method for setting a good-state threshold is based on maintaining the state within the range of natural variation in undisturbed systems. Preliminary time-series analyses of marine seabed community biomass suggest this threshold is located between 54 and 79\% of the undisturbed state.},

We conclude that the inclusion of ecological indicators in end-to-end models is not only feasible, but provides needed guidance on describing ecosystem status relative to strategic as well as tactical ecosystem-level management goals, and will escalate the implementation of EBM.},

Integrated ecosystem assessments (IEA) integrate system components so that managers can evaluate pathways to achieve desired goals. Indicators are a central element of IEAs and capture the status and trend of individual components and should be sensitive to changes in the system; however, most indicators are aggregated over space and time as annual values, potentially leading to incomplete or inaccurate inferences about system change. Here, we demonstrate the utility of spatially and temporally explicit ecological indicators by fitting multivariate spatio-temporal models to survey data from the northeast US Shelf Ecosystem, encompassing three distinct ecoregions: Georges Bank, Gulf of Maine, and mid-Atlantic Bight. We evaluate three case studies to explore how these models can help assess ecosystem performance relative to management objectives, such as to: (1) identify dominant modes of variation in zooplankton communities; (2) quantify components of system stability; and (3) assess the density-dependent condition of groundfish over time. Collectively, these three examples demonstrate multiple interesting processes, but particularly highlight the rapid zooplankton changes and associated changes in benthivore condition and stability in the Gulf of Maine. Attributing changes in ecosystem indicators to localized processes is difficult using conventional “regionally aggregated” indicators, so this example highlights the benefits of spatio-temporal methods for integrated ecosystem analysis in this and other regions.},

	abstract = {Seafood is an essential source of protein for more than 3 billion people worldwide, yet bycatch of threatened species in capture fisheries remains a major impediment to fisheries sustainability. Management measures designed to reduce bycatch often result in significant economic losses and even fisheries closures. Static spatial management approaches can also be rendered ineffective by environmental variability and climate change, as productive habitats shift and introduce new interactions between human activities and protected species. We introduce a new multispecies and dynamic approach that uses daily satellite data to track ocean features and aligns scales of management, species movement, and fisheries. To accomplish this, we create species distribution models for one target species and three bycatch-sensitive species using both satellite telemetry and fisheries observer data. We then integrate species-specific probabilities of occurrence into a single predictive surface, weighing the contribution of each species by management concern. We find that dynamic closures could be 2 to 10 times smaller than existing static closures while still providing adequate protection of endangered nontarget species. Our results highlight the opportunity to implement near real-time management strategies that would both support economically viable fisheries and meet mandated conservation objectives in the face of changing ocean conditions. With recent advances in eco-informatics, dynamic management provides a new climate-ready approach to support sustainable fisheries.},

	abstract = {Dynamic ocean management, which leverages near real-time data to adaptively shift management in response to changing ocean conditions, is gaining attention as an alternative to static approaches for managing dynamic fisheries challenges. While promising, dynamic management can be data-intensive, costly, and difficult to implement, and its value relative to simpler static approaches should be evaluated before being applied, especially when endangered species and economically crucial fisheries are at risk. Here, we use management strategy evaluation to compare static and dynamic management strategies for reducing humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) entanglement risk in the highly lucrative California Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister) trap fishery. We find that simple gear reductions outperform dynamic management strategies across several measures of performance. Gear reductions maintain uninterrupted fishing seasons and high fisheries catch and effectively prevent whale entanglement risk by directly reducing the number of vertical trap lines. Furthermore, gear reductions are robust to delayed openings resulting from biotoxin contamination and low meat quality, do not depend on the availability or accuracy of entanglement risk indicators, add no new management costs or enforcement challenges, and avoid biases in geographical equity. Dynamic management strategies, which proactively or reactively respond to indicators of entanglement risk, struggle to achieve their intended benefits because they are implemented after long logistical delays and because they redistribute rather than reduce entanglement risk. Bycatch threatens protected species and valuable fisheries around the world and models like the one developed here present valuable tools for weighing solutions to complex fisheries and conservation challenges.},

	abstract = {Changing distribution and abundance of small pelagic fishes may drive changes in predator distributions, affecting predator availability to fisheries and surveys. However, small pelagics are difficult to survey directly, so we developed a novel method of assessing the aggregate abundance of 21 small pelagic forage taxa via predator stomach contents. We used stomach contents collected from 22 piscivore species captured by multiple bottom trawl surveys within a vector autoregressive spatio-temporal model to assess trends of small pelagics on the Northeast US shelf. The goal was to develop a spatial “forage index” to inform survey and (or) fishery availability in the western North Atlantic bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) stock assessment. This spatially resolved index compared favorably with more traditional design-based survey biomass indices for forage species well sampled by surveys. However, our stomach content-based index better represented smaller unmanaged forage species that surveys are not designed to capture. The stomach-based forage index helped explain bluefish availability to the recreational fishery for stock assessment and provided insight into pelagic forage trends throughout the regional ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Trait-based climate vulnerability assessment (CVA) is a rapid and repeatable approach to simultaneously assess the vulnerability of a large number of species to projected regional changes in climate. We conducted the first CVA in the U.S. South Atlantic Large Marine Ecosystem for 71 ecologically, economically, and culturally important fish and invertebrate species. The CVA was conducted by a 16-member panel based on scoring 12 biological sensitivity attributes and seven climate exposure factors. About two-thirds of the species were considered highly vulnerability to future climate projected under the RCP 8.5 emissions scenario, with diadromous species, invertebrates, and deepwater reef fishes the most vulnerable functional groups. Ocean acidification, sea surface temperature, and salinity were the exposure factors with the greatest influence on climate vulnerability, while population growth rate, population status, and early life history traits were the most important biological sensitivity attributes. More than two-thirds of the species had high potential for shifts in geographic distribution, due mostly to the prevalence of broadcast spawning, extensive larval dispersal, and high adult mobility of many species, and the generalist habitat requirements of several estuary-dependent and hard-bottom reef species. Some shifts in distribution have already occurred though potential relationships to environmental conditions associated with climate are not well-understood. Uncertainty analyses confirmed the robustness of the climate vulnerability rankings, but comparison of alternative types of elicited informed judgement did not always agree, suggesting higher uncertainty in climate vulnerability for some species. In addition, several species may benefit under future climate conditions, and climate effects on some species considered to be highly vulnerable may be of relatively small magnitude. These results can be used to prioritize conservation, research, and management efforts, and identify key uncertainties related to the impacts of future climate on fishery resources in the U.S. South Atlantic region.},

	abstract = {Climate change and the associated shifts in species distributions and ecosystem functioning pose a significant challenge to the sustainability of marine fisheries and the human communities dependent upon them. In the California Current, as recent, rapid, and widespread changes have been observed across regional marine ecosystems, there is an urgent need to develop and implement adaptive and climate-ready fisheries management strategies. Climate Vulnerability Assessments (CVA) have been proposed as a first-line approach towards allocating limited resources and identifying those species and stocks most in need of further research and/or management intervention. Here we perform a CVA for 34 California state-managed fish and invertebrate species, following a methodology previously developed for and applied to federally managed species. We found Pacific herring, warty sea cucumber, and California spiny lobster to be three of the species expected to be the most sensitive to climate impacts with California halibut, Pacific bonito, and Pacific hagfish expected to be the least sensitive. When considering climate sensitivity in combination with environmental exposure in both Near (2030–2060) and Far (2070–2100) Exposure climate futures, red abalone was classified as a species with Very High climate vulnerability in both periods. Dungeness and Pacific herring shifted from High to Very High climate vulnerability and Pismo clam and pink shrimp shifted from Moderate to Very High climate vulnerability as exposure conditions progressed. In providing a relative and holistic comparison of the degree to which state-managed marine fishery species are likely to be impacted as climate change progresses, our results can help inform strategic planning initiatives and identify where gaps in scientific knowledge and management capacity may pose the greatest risk to California’s marine resource dependent economies and coastal communities.},

From 2017 to 2019, trends in biomass estimates from four surveys used to monitor Gulf of Alaska pollock diverged. These conflicting trends increased uncertainty in the stock assessment and occurred during a time of rapid environmental change. We hypothesized that changes in spawn timing affected availability of pollock to a winter survey that targets pre-spawning aggregations. To test this, we reconstructed relative spawn timing using two independent data sources: spring larval surveys and observations of spawning state in mature female pollock. We found that changes in spawn timing relative to survey timing explained a significant portion of recent and historical discrepancies between survey and model estimates of biomass. We then incorporated measures of spawn timing/survey timing mismatch as catchability covariates in an enhanced state-space stock assessment model. Including spawn timing-based catchability covariates significantly improved the model fit to survey data and provided a mechanistic explanation for recent survey discrepancies.},

With a focus on addressing localized and case-specific management needs, we provide a practical guide to the design and development of multi-indicator frameworks for fishery management. In a data-limited context, indicators are observations or estimates of the state of the fishery resource that are typically proxies for variables of interest, rather than quantities such as stock biomass estimated from data-rich stock assessments. Indicator frameworks structure the integration and interpretation of indicators to guide tactical fishery decision-making, often when the application of more formal analytical assessments is not feasible, yet where indicators in combination provide insight into stock status. With a focus on multi-indicator frameworks, we describe a pragmatic approach for their development via a set of organizational steps, considering a wide spectrum of types and severity of information limitations. We highlight where multi-indicator frameworks can be insightful and informative in relation to single indicator approaches but also point to potential pitfalls, with emphasis on critical evaluation and detection of performance flaws during the design phase using methods such as management strategy evaluation.},

Given the diversity of current environmental monitoring projects, and the large number of scientists and policy-makers involved, there is a critical need for a universal format that both summarizes data sets and indicates any potential need for management action. Control charts, originally developed for industrial applications, represent one way of doing this. Control charts indicate when a system is going ‘out of control’ by plotting through time some measure of a stochastic process with reference to its expected value. Control charts can be constructed for many different types of indicators, whether univariate or multivariate. Control charts are simple to interpret, and can easily be updated whenever additional data become available. The relative risks of Type I (i.e., concluding meaningful change has occurred when actually it has not) and Type II (i.e., concluding meaningful change has not occurred when in fact it has) errors are intuitive and easily adjusted, and one may define a threshold for action at any desired level. Control charts may often be more informative than traditional statistical analyses such as regressions or parameter estimation with confidence intervals. The primary challenge in most situations will be determining a stable or baseline state for the ecological indicator in question.},

	abstract = {Wide-ranging, indicator-based assessments of large, complex ecosystems are playing an increasing role in guiding environmental policy and management. An example is the EU’s Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which requires Member States to take measures to reach “good environmental status” (GES) in European marine waters. However, formulation of indicator targets consistent with the Directive’s high-level policy goal of sustainable use has proven challenging. We develop a specific, quantitative interpretation of the concepts of GES and sustainable use in terms of indicators and associated targets, by sharply distinguishing between current uses to satisfy current societal needs and preferences, and unknown future uses. We argue that consistent targets to safeguard future uses derive from a requirement that any environmental state indicator should recover within a defined time (e.g. 30 years) to its pressure-free range of variation when all pressures are hypothetically removed. Within these constraints, specific targets for current uses should be set. Routes to implementation of this proposal for indicators of fish-community size structure, population size of selected species, eutrophication, impacts of non-indigenous species, and genetic diversity are discussed. Important policy implications are that (a) indicator target ranges, which may be wider than natural ranges, systematically and rationally derive from our proposal; (b) because relevant state indicators tend to respond slowly, corresponding pressures should also be monitored and assessed; (c) support of current uses and safeguarding of future uses are distinct management goals, they require different types of targets, decision processes, and management philosophies.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem models have been developed to help support Ecosystem-Based Management and to help provide better management advice that can account for ecosystem impacts (e.g., climate, species interactions, fishing behaviour). Quantitative end-to-end models have proven to be very useful strategically for exploring future scenarios, but are data intensive, time consuming, and require considerable expertise and training. Conversely, qualitative models have different benefits: they are less dependent on data, relatively faster to develop, can incorporate different types of information that are difficult to measure or combine, and can be co-developed with a variety of audiences. There has been an increase in the use of qualitative models for marine management, however questions have arisen about how well qualitative models perform in comparison to quantitative models, and how they can be used to inform management. Here we compare results from quantitative and qualitative ecosystem models for the same region at differing levels of model complexity to explore their relative utility for EBM. We conclude that the number of linkages between model elements and trophic position of the perturbed model were influential factors in the qualitative model behaviour. When perturbing lower trophic level groups, higher complexity models performed closer to the quantitative model. Lower complexity models were recommended when estimating scenarios with perturbations to mid-trophic groups. Careful consideration among these issues is required to develop the “sweet spot” of model complexity for qualitative ecosystem models to reflect similar results to quantitative models. In addition, utilizing multiple models to determine the strongest impacts from perturbations is recommended to avoid spurious conclusions.},

Indicators to measure performance against objectives have been suggested, tested, and refined but with a strong bias towards ecological indicators. In this paper, current use and application of indicators related to the human dimension in EBFM research and ecosystem models are analysed. It is found that compared to ecological counterparts, few indicators related to the human dimension are commonly associated with EBFM, and they mainly report on economic objectives related to fisheries. Similarly, in the most common ecosystem models, economic indicators are the most frequently used related to the human dimension, both in terms of model outputs and inputs. The prospect is small that indicators mainly related to profitable fishing economy are able to report on meeting the broad range of EBFM objectives and to successfully evaluate progress in achieving EBFM goals. To fully conform with EBFM principles, it is necessary to recognise that ecological and human indicators are inter-dependent. Moreover, the end-to-end ecosystem models used in EBFM will need to be further developed to allow a fuller spectrum of social-cultural, institutional, and economic objectives to be reported against.},

	abstract = {Multispecies, multigear fisheries occur in most ecosystems in the world, but are typical in tropical ecosystems and especially in emerging economies. However, much of fishery science has been developed from a single-species perspective. Management schemes based on single-species reference points often ignore the trophic link among species and the technical interaction between gears, essentially disconnecting management objectives from the context of an ecosystem—or socioecological system—where fisheries operate. Using the Gulf of Thailand fishery as an example, we demonstrate how aggregate production models can be used to estimate system-level fishery reference points for multispecies fisheries. Our results show that the multispecies maximum sustainable yield changes with ecosystem state—the systemic productivity level due to species composition and ecological (trophic/habitat, etc.) structure—under various development levels of fishing and varies with management objectives such as biodiversity, system resilience, total catch, total value, and employment. Aggregate approaches are a tractable way of estimating sustainable ecosystem-scale extraction for multispecies fisheries, avoiding the dilemma of facing conflicting advice derived from single-species methods and providing a practical, operational step toward ecosystem-based management. However, these methods are sensitive to the ecosystem states over time and decision makers need to make informed decisions on which state they want to maintain (or recover) and thus which system-level reference points to use. Consequently, management of multispecies fisheries must be clear on their system-level fisheries policy objectives.},

The results show that the ranked scores of indicators are affected by the level of detail, both in terms of criteria and indicators, provided in the questionnaires. It appears that adding detail to the questionnaires makes the scoring process more transparent and provides better founded scores; at a certain point, however, more-detailed indicators and/or more-detailed criteria result in decreased performance of the scoring process, reflecting mostly factors that do not determine the suitability of the indicator (e.g. the level of familiarity), while giving the false impression of a more thorough analysis.},

	abstract = {Indicators are needed to support the implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF), by providing information on the state of the ecosystem, the extent and intensity of effort or mortality and the progress of management in relation to objectives. Here, I review recent work on the development, selection and application of indicators and consider how indicators might support an EAF. Indicators should guide the management of fishing activities that have led to, or are most likely to lead to, unsustainable impacts on ecosystem components or attributes. The numbers and types of indicators used to support an EAF will vary among management regions, depending on resources available for monitoring and enforcement, and actual and potential fishing impacts. State indicators provide feedback on the state of ecosystem components or attributes and the extent to which management objectives, which usually relate to state, are met. State can only be managed if the relationships with fishing (pressure) and management (response) are known. Predicting such relationships is fundamental to developing a management system that supports the achievement of objectives. In a management framework supported by pressure, state and response indicators, the relationship between the value of an indicator and a target or limit reference point, reference trajectory or direction provides guidance on the management action to take. Values of pressure, state and response indicators may be affected by measurement, process, model and estimation error and thus different indicators, and the same indicators measured at different scales and in different ways, will detect true trends on different timescales. Managers can use several methods to estimate the effects of error on the probability of detecting true trends and/or to account for error when setting reference points, trajectories and directions. Given the high noise to signal ratio in many state indicators, pressure and response indicators would often guide short-term management decision making more effectively, with state indicators providing longer-term policy-focused feedback on the effects of management action.},

To date, use of fisheries indicators for coral reefs has been rather piecemeal, with no overarching understanding of their performance with respect to highlighting fishing effects. Here, we provide a review of multispecies fishery-independent indicators used to evaluate fishing impacts on coral reefs. We investigate the consistency with which indicators highlight fishing effects on coral reefs. We then address questions of statistical power and uncertainty, type of fishing gradient, scale of analysis, the influence of other variables and the need for more work to set reference points for empirical, fisheries-independent indicators on coral reefs. Our review provides knowledge that will help underpin the assessment of the ecological effects of fishing, offering essential support for the development and implementation of coral reef fisheries management plans.},

	abstract = {Implementing ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM) will require a suite of ecological indices to track the state of an ecosystem, in addition to monitoring species-abundance for both economically important species, as well as species that are not targeted for harvest. However, EBFM implementation requires an examination of current methods and applications of ecological indices that are being used. This paper identifies four key uses for ecosystem indices in the context of EBFM and discusses the implications of each: (1) motivation for socio-political action, (2) information for individual users to modify their behavior, (3) implementation of decision rules for management evaluation, and (4) discovery of ecosystem functions to advance scientific knowledge. In a fisheries management context, ecological indicators will be linked to decision rules based on the definitions of both “ecosystem overfishing” and the current single-species definitions of overfishing. Two components of common ecological indicators are species weightings (i.e. catch or abundance data by species) and the species-specific ecological attributes (e.g. mortality rates, body size, trophic level). We discuss statistical issues that arise from estimating the parameters in ecological index calculations from both fishery-dependent and independent data and the potential biases introduced by using catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data, catch data, and abundance estimates. Given the range of biases that arise, often the best estimates of species weightings (abundances) are those derived from fish stock assessments. This implies that progress in EBFM may be best served by increasing the number of species for which single-species assessments are done and to expand the list of species to include species which may not be economically important. The policy framework exists to carry out EBFM; however, future works needs to focus on empirical management strategy simulations, as well as theoretical works to identify management criteria based on those indicators.},

Four years of preparation had borne fruit, and the stage was set with a programme of 40 presentations and nearly 150 posters.The symposium was centred on using ecosystem indicators for fisheries management, and as such reflects the growing understanding that exploited fish populations must be considered as integral components of ecosystem function, rather than units that operate independently of their environment. Internationally, there has been wide recognition of the need to move towards an ecosystem approach to fisheries, a development spearheaded by FAO through their Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (Garcia, 2000), and supported by many regional and national institutions as well as academia, NGOs, and the general public. Intergovernmental organizations providing management advice, such as ICES and PICES, require meaningful indicators that adequately reflect the state of marine ecosystems.},

Implementation of ecosystem-based management (EBM) relies in part on ecological indicators that link science to policy while also providing a means to explore ecosystem response to change and to assess progress toward management and policy goals. EBM requires reliable and robust indicators at commensurate spatial scales to assess the ecological impacts of pressures and management actions. We evaluated the spatial and temporal behaviour of ecological indicators at multiple spatial scales to answer three main questions: (i) Is the spatial and temporal resolution of current data collection in the Scotian Shelf fine-grained enough to detect changes in key indicators at the strata level? (ii) How closely do fluctuations in time series at the survey strata level match those at the larger spatial scales? (iii) Is there spatial coherence across survey strata and indicators?

	abstract = {To implement ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), there is a need to comprehensively examine fundamental components of fisheries ecosystems and ascertain the characteristics and strategies facilitating this more systematic approach. Coupled natural and human factors, inherent biological productivities, and systematic governance measures all influence living marine resource (LMR) and socioeconomic status within a given socio-ecological system (SES). Determining the relative prominence of these factors remains a challenge. Examining these facets to determine how much EBFM and wise LMR management occurs is timely and warranted given the many issues facing marine fisheries ecosystems. Here we characterize major United States (U.S.) marine fishery ecosystems by examining these facets and compiling a consistent, multidisciplinary view of these coupled SESs using commonly available, integrated data for each ecosystem. We then examine if major patterns and lessons emerge when comparing across SESs. This work also seeks to elucidate what are the determinants of successful LMR management. Although U.S.-centric, the breadth of the ecosystems explored here are likely globally applicable. Overall, we observed that inherent biological productivity was a major driver determining the level of fisheries biomass, landings, and LMR economic value for a given region, but that human interventions can offset basal production. We observed that good governance could overcome certain ecosystem limitations, and vice versa, especially as tradeoffs within regions have intensified over time. We also found that all U.S. regions are performing well in terms of certain aspects of LMR management, with unique successes and challenges observed in all regions. Although attributes of marine fisheries ecosystems differ among regions, there are commonalities that can be applied and transferred across them. These include having: clear stock status identified; relatively stable but attentive management interventions; clear tracking of broader ecosystem considerations; landings to biomass exploitation rates at typically {\textless} 0.1; areal landings at typically {\textless} 1 t km2 year−1; ratios of landings relative to primary production at typically {\textless} 0.001; and explicit consideration of socio-economic factors directly in management. Integrated, cross-disciplinary perspectives and systematic comparative syntheses such as this one offer insight in determining regionally-specific and overarching approaches for successful LMR management.},

	abstract = {The United States has a new national ocean policy that adopts ecosystem-based management (EBM) as its first principle for managing U.S. ocean spaces and marine resources. However, U.S. laws that govern the uses of ocean spaces present a challenging tangle of authorities and mandates that do not easily facilitate ecosystem-based policies. For over 30 years, U.S. marine fisheries management has been guided by eight Regional Fishery Management Councils. Working under the many laws that guide setting stewardship priorities for ocean ecosystems, councils provide the Federal Government with advice on fisheries harvest levels, fish habitat protections, and fishing community needs. Implementing EBM for any ocean ecosystem requires a careful examination of the laws and policy processes that affect human interaction with that ecosystem. This article explores the U.S. perspective on federal ecosystem-based fisheries management, its part in U.S. national ocean policy, and how fishery management councils might position themselves as both EBM policymakers and policy takers for ocean resource management.},

A conceptual reframing of fisheries management is occurring globally, which envisions fisheries as systems with interacting biophysical and human subsystems. This broader view, along with a process for decision making, can facilitate implementation of EBFM. A pathway to achieve these broadened objectives of EBFM in the United States is a Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP). The first generation of FEPs was conceived in the late 1990s as voluntary guidance documents that Regional Fishery Management Councils could adopt to develop and guide their ecosystem-based fisheries management decisions, but few of these FEPs took concrete steps to implement EBFM. Here, we emphasize the need for a new generation of FEPs that provide practical mechanisms for putting EBFM into practice in the United States. We argue that next-generation FEPs can balance environmental, economic, and social objectives—the triple bottom line—to improve long-term planning for fishery systems.},

	abstract = {U.S. fisheries management has made tremendous strides under the current management framework, which centers on single stocks rather than ecosystems. However, conventional management focuses on one fishing sector at a time, considers a narrow range of issues, and is separated into individual fishery management plans often leaving little opportunity to consider overarching management goals across fisheries. Ecosystem-based Fisheries Management (EBFM) provides mechanisms to address these but has not been widely adopted. Here, we review and analyze the development of Fisheries Ecosystem Plans (FEPs) as a means to implement EBFM. In doing so, we provide a blueprint for next-generation FEPS that have the potential to translate EBFM to action. We highlight FEPs as a structured planning process that uses adaptive management to operationalize EBFM. This “FEP Loop” process starts by identifying the key factors that shape a fishery system and considering them simultaneously, as a coherent whole. It then helps managers and stakeholders delineate their overarching goals for the system and refine them into specific, realistic projects. And it charts a course forward with a set of management actions that work in concert to achieve the highest-priority objectives. We conclude that EBFM is feasible today using existing science tools, policy instruments, and management structures. Not only that, nearly all of the steps in the proposed “FEP Loop” process are presently being carried out by U.S. fishery managers. The process of reviewing regional experiences in developing and applying the FEP loop will lead to adaptations and improvements of the process we propose.},

An ELRP is an ecosystem harvest level or indicator with one or more associated benchmarks or thresholds (i.e., targets, limits) to identify, monitor, or maintain desirable ecosystem conditions and functions.This paper explores the development and implementation of ELRPs in fisheries management to support ecosystem and fisheries sustainability, help identify when ecosystem changes that impact fisheries resources occur, and foster discussions of trade‐offs in management decisions.We organize existing and potential ELRPs into five categories (statistical analysis of nonlinear dynamics and tipping points, ecosystem productivity, ecosystem trophic information, biodiversity, and human dimensions), provide an overview of analytical methods that can estimate ELRP benchmarks, provide examples of where ELRP benchmarks are being used today, and evaluate pros and cons of the different ELRP categories. We also attempt to identify potential next steps for fisheries scientists and managers to further the science, development, and application of ELRPs.Ecosystem‐level reference points can be used as a proactive accountability mechanism to achieve ecosystem objectives and maintain the ecosystem in a preferred operating space or as an early warning that ecosystem‐level changes (e.g., tipping points) could be imminent if current biological and ecological trends in the system continue.Impact statementEcosystem‐level reference points (ELRPs) are a fundamental concept in ecosystem‐based fisheries management (EBFM) that are not currently being used to their full potential.

In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) developed an EBFM Policy in 2016, accompanied by a Road Map of 49 action items, to support marine ecosystem-based management and conservation of fisheries, habitats, and protected species under U.S. federal jurisdiction. In 2024, NOAA Fisheries updated its EBFM Policy and Road Map and formed a team of science and policy experts to review progress and derive lessons learned during the first Road Map iteration. Four key lessons emerged: (1) progress toward EBFM in the U.S. has been substantial; (2) greater coordination could further enhance progress; (3) more effort is required to link science to management activities; and (4) human dimensions need greater integration throughout EBFM implementation. Enabling factors for progress on the Road Map included: champions at both the leadership and staff levels; use of participatory processes; motivation driven by ecosystem shocks and threats; and leveraging existing processes and frameworks. The updated EBFM Road Map supports historic and ongoing efforts to implement U.S. laws through improved coordination, integration, and knowledge exchange and can help to address many urgent challenges facing U.S. marine fisheries, habitats, and protected resources.},

	abstract = {Assessment of the historical, present, and future states of marine ecosystems and the effects that humans and climate have on the state of an ecosystem are crucial to the scientific advice required to implement an ecosystem-based fishery management system. Management of federal groundfish fisheries in Alaska considers not just the target fishery, but also the possible impact those fisheries might have on other species and the ecosystem. Management actions have ranged from providing protection of endangered species in the region to preventing new fisheries from starting on key foodweb components such as forage fish. A scientific framework for providing ecosystem-based advice that puts the ecosystem first has been evolving over the past few years. This framework provides a way of assessing ecosystem factors that influence target species, the impact the target fishery may have on associated species, and ecosystem-level impacts of fishing. An indicator approach that describes ecosystem status, and trends and measures of human and climate influence has been developed to provide advice to fishery managers. This approach is now being expanded to utilize a variety of models to predict possible future trends in various ecosystem indicators. Future implementation challenges include the refinement of these predictive models, and the inclusion of climate into the models. Identification of sensitive and meaningful ecosystem indicators is also required before a more formalized decision-making process, one that includes ecosystem considerations, can be developed. Most important, the culture of fishery management and research organizations needs to change to embrace the ecosystem-based protections already mandated by various laws.},

	abstract = {Borne out of a collective movement towards ecosystem-based management (EBM), multispecies and multi-sector scientific assessments of the ocean are emerging around the world. In the USA, integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs) were formally defined 5 years ago to serve as a scientific foundation for marine EBM. As outlined by the US National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration in 2008, an IEA is a cyclical process consisting of setting goals and targets, defining indicators, analysing status, trends, and risk, and evaluating alternative potential future management and environmental scenarios to enhance information needed for effective EBM. These steps should be hierarchical, iterative, non-prescriptive about technical implementation, and adaptable to existing information for any ecosystem. Despite these strengths and some initial successes, IEAs and EBM have yet to be fully realized in the USA. We propose eight tenets that can be adopted by scientists, policy-makers, and managers to enhance the use of IEAs in implementing EBM. These tenets include (i) engage with stakeholders, managers, and policy-makers early, often, and continually; (ii) conduct rigorous human dimensions research; (iii) recognize the importance of transparently selecting indicators; (iv) set ecosystem targets to create a system of EBM accountability; (v) establish a formal mechanism(s) for the review of IEA science; (vi) serve current management needs, but not at the expense of more integrative ocean management; (vii) provide a venue for EBM decision-making that takes full advantage of IEA products; and (viii) embrace realistic expectations about IEA science and its implementation. These tenets are framed in a way that builds on domestic and international experiences with ocean management. With patience, persistence, political will, funding, and augmented capacity, IEAs will provide a general approach for allowing progressive science to lead conventional ocean management to new waters.},

Here, we synthesize progress toward implementing EBFM in the United States through one potential avenue: expanding fish stock assessments to include ecosystem considerations and interactions between species, fleets, and sectors. We reviewed over 200 stock assessments and assessed how the stock assessment reports included information about system influences on the assessed stock. Our goals were to quantify whether and how assessments incorporated broader system-level considerations, and to explore factors that might contribute to the use of system-level information. Interactions among fishing fleets (technical interactions) were more commonly included than biophysical interactions (species, habitat, climate). Interactions within the physical environment (habitat, climate) were included twice as often as interactions among species (predation). Many assessment reports included ecological interactions only as background or qualitative considerations, rather than incorporating them in the assessment model. Our analyses suggested that ecosystem characteristics are more likely to be included when the species was overfished (stock status), the assessment is conducted at a science centre with a longstanding stomach contents analysis program, and/or the species life history characteristics suggest it is likely to be influenced by the physical environment, habitat, or predation mortality (short-lived species, sessile benthic species, or low trophic-level species). Regional differences in stomach contents analysis programs may limit the inclusion of predation mortality in stock assessments, and more guidance is needed on best practices for the prioritization of when and how biophysical information should be considered. However, our results demonstrate that significant progress has been made to use best available science and data to expand single-species stock assessments, particularly when a broad definition of EBFM is applied.},

The clarity of what EBFM means is sharpening each year and there is now a real need to evaluate progress and assess the effectiveness and impacts. By examining a suite of over 90 indicators (including socioeconomic, governance, environmental forcing, major pressures, systems ecology, and fisheries criteria) for 9 major US fishery ecosystem jurisdictions, the authors systematically track the progress the country has made towards advancing EBFM and making it an operational reality. The assessment covers a wide range of data in both time (multiple decades) and space (from the tropics to the poles, representing over 10\% of the world's ocean surface area). The authors view progress towards the implementation of EBFM as synonymous with improved management of living marine resources in general, and highlight the findings from a national perspective. Although US-centric, the lessons learned are directly applicable for all parts of the global ocean. Much work remains, but significant progress has already been made to better address many of the challenges facing the sustainable management of our living marine resources.

	abstract = {Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) is a systematic approach to fisheries management in a geographically specified area that contributes to the resilience and sustainability of the ecosystem. In the US, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) implements EBFM under federal laws, including the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), which defines essential fish habitat (EFH). NOAA Fisheries implements the EFH consultation requirements of the MSA to mitigate potential sources of anthropogenic impacts, conserve EFH, and support sustainable fisheries. There is little research regarding management outcomes resulting from EFH consultations. We demonstrate three Alaska case studies, where inter-agency consultations regarding impacts on EFH resulted in localized management outcomes in (1) offshore, (2) nearshore, and (3) watershed habitats. The first established a framework to improve emergency response preparedness for large scale oil spills offshore. The resultant programmatic EFH consultation provided the foundation to conduct a robust analysis identifying sensitive habitat zones to avoid dispersant use in offshore oil spill response. The second explores an EFH consultation where conservation recommendations informed modifications to a construction project to protect nearshore fish nursery habitats. Project managers implemented numerous mitigation measures, including eelgrass surveys, adopted no work windows, and adhered to acoustic thresholds to minimize impacts. The third is an analysis of a proposed, large-scale mining operation in a salmon bearing watershed. Central to this consultation was the inherent difference between landscape reclamation and hydrologic restoration. In each, we present the EFH consultation process, conservation recommendations, and the role of science informing the overall management outcomes. This science-based practice supports core components of EBFM.},

	abstract = {Fisheries science agencies are responsible for informing fisheries management and ocean planning worldwide, often requiring scientific analysis and management actions across multiple spatial scales. For example, catch limits are typically defined annually over regional scales, fishery bycatch rules are defined at fine spatial scales on daily to annual time scales, and aquaculture and energy lease areas are defined over decades for subregional permitting at intermediate scales. Similarly, these activities require synthesizing monitoring data and mechanistic knowledge operating across different spatial resolutions and domains. These needs drive a growing role for models that predict animal presence or densities at fine spatial scales, including daily, seasonal, and interannual variation, often called species distribution/density models (SDMs). SDMs can inform many ocean management needs; however, their development and usage are often haphazard. In this paper we discuss various ways SDMs can and have been used in stock, habitat, protected species, and ecosystem management activities as well as marine spatial planning, survey optimization, and as an interface with ecosystem and climate models. We conclude with a discussion of future directions, focusing on information needs and current development, and highlight avenues for furthering the community of practice around SDM development and use.},

	abstract = {Effectively modeling the impact of climate change on any population requires careful consideration of diverse pressures. Potential changes in interactions with other species must be accounted for. As communities reassemble and shifts in abundance and distribution cascade throughout ecosystems, cumulative impacts on species of conservation concern need to be explicitly examined. A structured qualitative analysis of alternative responses to climate change across the food web can play a valuable role in the design and interpretation of quantitative models. A particular advantage of qualitative network analysis is the ease with which a wide range of scenarios representing structural and quantitative uncertainties can be explored. We tested 36 plausible representations of connections among salmon and key functional groups within the marine food web using qualitative network models. The scenarios differed in how species pairs were connected (positive, negative, or no interaction) and which species responded directly to climate change. Our analysis showed that certain configurations produced consistently negative outcomes for salmon, regardless of the specific values for most of the links. Salmon outcomes shifted from 30\% to 84\% negative when consumption rates by multiple competitor and predator groups increased following a press perturbation from climate. This scenario aligns with some recent observations during a marine heatwave. Feedbacks between salmon and mammalian predators were particularly important, as were indirect effects connecting spring- and fall-run salmon. We also identified which links most strongly influenced salmon outcomes in other scenarios. Our results emphasize the importance of structural uncertainty in food webs and demonstrate a tool for exploring it, paving the way for more targeted and effective research planning.},

	abstract = {Climate change and its impacts are increasingly threatening the ability of marine protected areas (MPA) to meet their conservation goals. While integration of climate change into planning is critical, a recent global analysis found that relatively few MPAs have incorporated climate change considerations into formal management planning processes. Despite this, sessions and discussions at the Fifth International Marine Protected Areas Congress (IMPAC5) demonstrate that climate-adaptive management already permeates MPA processes, from day-to-day management to design and implementation. Here we review the results of an IMPAC5 knowledge exchange session that brought together a diverse group of MPA managers, Indigenous community representatives, and thought leaders to discuss improved integration of climate change into MPA management and planning. The session demonstrated the vibrancy, diversity, and engagement represented in the dynamic and fast-moving field of MPA climate change management and planning. In addition to sharing unique and diverse perspectives, the session leveraged the experience of experts to identify new and common challenges and gaps. As a result of this session, we present five recommendations, building on previous work, to guide MPA managers in the explicit and successful incorporation of climate adaptation into management planning and implementation. These recommendations hold the goal of ensuring an equitable, adaptive, and robust global MPA system. This review also provides a valuable summary of the vast repository of experience and knowledge of climate adaptive management contained within the MPA management community, and with community and Indigenous partners. Such perspectives are rarely reflected in formal scientific, policy, and management publications.},

Using social network analysis techniques, including network visualization, cohesion measures, programs degree and betweenness centrality, similarities among programs in different topic areas (e.g., type of audience, partners, training, EBM best management practices and principles) were explored. Results highlight substantial differences in perceived and effective performances across programs, with Management programs showing a higher level of integration of EBM approaches than Non-Management programs. The use of EBM best management practices and principles among programs is unbalanced, with some key elements of EBM strategies less commonly employed in the management planning. This analysis identified gaps in the implementation of EBM strategies that can inform natural resource managers and other interested parties. This paper presents the results of the analysis and discusses the implications for the implementation of EBM approaches and strategies at the federal level.},

This unavoidable reduction of survey data poses challenges for informing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, developing future stock assessments of harvested species, and providing strategic advice for ecosystem-based management. We present a diversified framework involving integration of monitoring data with empirical models and simulations to inform ecosystem status within the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. We augment trawl observations collected from a limited fisheries survey with survey effort reduction simulations, use of seabird diets as indicators of fish abundance, and krill species distribution modeling trained on past observations. This diversified approach allows for evaluation of ecosystem status during data-poor situations, especially during the COVID-19 era. The challenges to ecosystem monitoring imposed by the pandemic may be overcome by preparing for unexpected effort reduction, linking disparate ecosystem indicators, and applying new species modeling techniques.},

	abstract = {Climate variability and change are having dramatic effects on marine species, fisheries, and fishing communities. Climate perturbations elicit fishery management responses intended to mitigate negative effects, but the responses often do not account for the complexity of fisheries systems, leading to unintended consequences. However, including more diverse forms of ecological, economic, and social information reveals elements of system structure that could lead to more climate-adaptive management approaches and better outcomes. Here, we examine four U.S. case studies that span a range of climate-fisheries interactions: target species distribution shifts; bycatch of juvenile fish; harmful algal blooms that delay fishery openings; and offshore wind energy development on fishing grounds. In each example, as management actions or plans were undertaken to mitigate climate impacts, subsequent quantitative and qualitative indicators and knowledge revealed potential system feedbacks, fishery participant responses, and/or undesirable fishery outcomes. These case studies highlight the complex and iterative nature of developing climate-adaptive strategies for fisheries management. They also illustrate that how we define “fishing community” is a key determinant of both the outcomes of climate-driven management actions and how those outcomes are perceived. Finally, they underscore the value of engagement and knowledge exchange among participants, scientists and managers, and provide insight as to how to more rigorously apply “best available science” to climate-ready fisheries management, in accordance with fishery policies and laws that emphasize both biological and social outcomes.},

Specifically, we review governance frameworks, ecosystem policy, fishery ecosystem plans, catch accounting systems, trawl bycatch controls, trawl area closures and habitat protections, gear modifications, a Crab Rationalization Program, Ecosystem and Economic Status Reports, and Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles. The strongest EBFM features of this management system include mechanisms to avoid overfishing, use of scientific knowledge, consideration of ecosystem connections, appropriate monitoring, acknowledging uncertainty, stakeholder involvement, and decisions that reflect societal choice. Some EBFM principles, such as the efficacy of gear and area closures and accounting for the dynamic nature of ecosystems have room for improvement. In spite of the large number of EBFM measures in place, three of the eight BSAI crab stocks with biomass estimates were below their minimum stock size thresholds, and thus classified as “overfished” in 2023. The lack of apparent correspondence between implemented EBFM actions and crab stock trends may indicate that environmentally driven sporadic recruitment, spikes in natural mortality, and stock range shifts mute favorable responses to EBFM actions or that outstanding critical EBFM measures have yet to be addressed. In the face of recent large-scale changes in the marine ecosystems of the BSAI and an outlook for greater changes in the future, it is increasingly important to routinely reevaluate interactions between crab, their ecosystems, fisheries and fishing communities.},

	abstract = {Time series indicators are widely used in ecosystem-based management. A suite of indicators is typically calculated for a static region or multiple subregions and presented in an ecosystem assessment (EA). These are used to guide management decisions or determine environmental status. Yet, few studies have examined how the spatial scale of an EA influences indicator behavior. We explore this question using the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf ecosystem (USA). We systematically divided the ecosystem at six spatial scales (31 unique units), covering spatial extents from 250,000 km2 to 20,000 km2. The same 22 indicators were calculated for each unit, assessed for trends, and evaluated as 31 independent EAs. We found that the detected signals of indicator trends depended on the spatial scale at which the ecosystem was defined. A single EA for the whole region differed by 23\% (in terms of the 22 indicator trend tests) relative to ones for spatially nested 120,000 km2 subunits, and by up to 36\% for EAs at smaller scales. Indicator trend disagreement occurred because (most common) a localized trend was perceived as widespread, (common) a local trend was obscured by aggregating data over a large region, or (least common) a local trend switched direction when examined at a broader scale. Yet, there was variation among indicators in their scale sensitivity related to trophic level. Indicators of temperature, chlorophyll-a, and zooplankton were spatially coherent: trends portrayed were similar regardless of scale. Mid-trophic level indicators (fish and invertebrates) showed more spatial variation in trends. We also compared trend magnitude and indicator values to spatial extent and found relationships consistent with scaling theory. Indicators at broad scales produced subdued trends and values relative to indicators developed at smaller spatial scales, which often portrayed ‘hotspots’ of local abundance or strong trend. Our results imply that subsequent uses of indicators (e.g., determining environmental status, risk assessments, management decisions) are also sensitive to ecosystem delineation and scale. We suggest that indicators and EAs should be done at multiple spatial scales and complimented with spatially explicit analysis to reflect the hierarchical structure of ecosystems. One scale is not best, but rather we gain a new level of understanding at each scale examined that can contribute to management decisions in a multiscale governance framework characterized by goals and objectives with relevance at different scales.},

	abstract = {Bottom trawling is widespread globally and impacts seabed habitats. However, risks from trawling remain unquantified at large scales in most regions. We address these issues by synthesizing evidence on the impacts of different trawl-gear types, seabed recovery rates, and spatial distributions of trawling intensity in a quantitative indicator of biotic status (relative amount of pretrawling biota) for sedimentary habitats, where most bottom-trawling occurs, in 24 regions worldwide. Regional average status relative to an untrawled state (=1) was high ({\textgreater}0.9) in 15 regions, but {\textless}0.7 in three (European) regions and only 0.25 in the Adriatic Sea. Across all regions, 66\% of seabed area was not trawled (status = 1), 1.5\% was depleted (status = 0), and 93\% had status {\textgreater} 0.8. These assessments are first order, based on parameters estimated with uncertainty from meta-analyses; we recommend regional analyses to refine parameters for local specificity. Nevertheless, our results are sufficiently robust to highlight regions needing more effective management to reduce exploitation and improve stock sustainability and seabed environmental status—while also showing seabed status was high ({\textgreater}0.95) in regions where catches of trawled fish stocks meet accepted benchmarks for sustainable exploitation, demonstrating that environmental benefits accrue from effective fisheries management. Furthermore, regional seabed status was related to the proportional area swept by trawling, enabling preliminary predictions of regional status when only the total amount of trawling is known. This research advances seascape-scale understanding of trawl impacts in regions around the world, enables quantitative assessment of sustainability risks, and facilitates implementation of an ecosystem approach to trawl fisheries management globally.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem indicators are a well-established method for tracking ecosystem conditions and trends with the purpose of informing ecosystem-based management. The selection of indicators is a key step in the management process; however, because 1) selection can be inherently subjective 2) researchers can be entrenched in the ecosystem components they routinely measure, and 3) some voices may be marginalized in a group setting, the selection, prioritization, and consensus processes can be challenging. To overcome these issues, an indicator selection process was developed herein that incorporated expert opinion both qualitatively and quantitatively. The decision matrix asked experts to provide weighted values for each selection criterion and a score of how well each potential indicator fit each criterion. The score of how well the indicators fit the criterion was multiplied by the weight given to that criterion, then summed for all criteria, resulting in an overall score of how well a potential indicator fit the criteria. The indicator scores were then ranked using all experts’ scores to develop a single best-fit list of indicators. The approach was pilot-tested to select indicators for the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS), creating a prioritized list of indicators that best reflected the condition of the FKNMS resources, ecosystem services, and pressures. Specifically, 56 indicators were found to best model the status and trends associated with 16 standard questions regarding condition of national marine sanctuaries. This process is directly transferable to other national marine sanctuaries, and also identifies data gaps. The criteria can be modified to make the selection process applicable to a wide range of ecosystem-based management applications in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. This method provides a means of selecting indicators that minimizes the effects of group dynamics on consensus.},

a holistic, ecosystem-scale evaluation of reef fish community status using large-scale diver surveys that sampled across a spatial gradient of human urbanization, exploitation, and fishery protection. Key aspects of the analysis were: (1) identification of a low human impact reference area
as the basis for quantifying resource condition; (2) selection of indicator variables that helped discriminate two classes of impacts: habitat quality and fishing; (3) application of estimation methods that facilitated distinguishing anthropogenic impacts from inherent productivity of different
habitats; and (4) use of a sustainability benchmark to gauge the resource condition of the reference area. The reference-centering analysis approach reduced reliance on qualitative judgements by an expert panel and produced results on a scale that was informative and could be easily interpreted

Ideally the suite of indicators should represent key information about structure, function, and composition of the ecological system. Three concerns hamper the use of ecological indicators as a resource management tool. (1) Monitoring programs often depend on a small number of indicators and fail to consider the full complexity of the ecological system. (2) Choice of ecological indicators is confounded in management programs that have vague long-term goals and objectives. (3) Management and monitoring programs often lack scientific rigor because of their failure to use a defined protocol for identifying ecological indicators. Thus, ecological indicators need to capture the complexities of the ecosystem yet remain simple enough to be easily and routinely monitored. Ecological indicators should meet the following criteria: be easily measured, be sensitive to stresses on the system, respond to stress in a predictable manner, be anticipatory, predict changes that can be averted by management actions, be integrative, have a known response to disturbances, anthropogenic stresses, and changes over time, and have low variability in response. The challenge is to derive a manageable set of indicators that together meet these criteria.},

This paper outlines a framework for measuring human well-being for ecosystem-based management (EBM). We present a prototype that can be adapted and developed for various scales and contexts. Scientists and managers use indicators to assess status and trends in integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs). To improve the social science rigor and success of EBM, we developed a systematic and transparent approach for evaluating indicators of human well-being for an IEA.Methods: Our process is based on a comprehensive conceptualization of human well-being, a scalable analysis of management priorities, and a set of indicator screening criteria tailored to the needs of EBM. We tested our approach by evaluating more than 2000 existing social indicators related to ocean and coastal management of the US West Coast. We focused on two foundational attributes of human well-being: resource access and self-determination.Outcomes and Discussion: Our results suggest that existing indicators and data are limited in their ability to reflect linkages between environmental change and human well-being, and extremely limited in their ability to assess social equity and justice. We reveal a critical need for new social indicators tailored to answer environmental questions and new data that are disaggregated by social variables to measure equity. In both, we stress the importance of collaborating with the people whose well-being is to be assessed.Conclusion: Our framework is designed to encourage governments and communities to carefully assess the complex tradeoffs inherent in environmental decision-making.},

	abstract = {Although most fisheries assessment and management focuses on the status of individual stocks, and regulations are commonly established as single-species total allowable catch limits (TACs), much of the catch from global fisheries comes from mixed-stock fisheries where species cannot be harvested separately. We show that in some fisheries where TAC and catch of demersal fish stocks are tracked, the average fraction of TAC harvested ranges from 21\% to 68\% overall and is declining. This is, in part, related to efforts to protect all species from overfishing, leading to ‘choke species’, which limit fishing pressure on other target species. While some choke species arise from a mix of low and high-productivity species, others result from allocation processes, which can be aggravated by shifting distributions due to climate change. Underutilization of TACs can also result from market limitations, low value of individual species, undercapacity or management measures. Proposed methods for increasing long-term yield require species to be managed in stock groups, or allowing the abundance of some stocks to fall below target reference points. We suggest that the observed low and declining aggregate harvests are due, primarily, to the focus on single-stock sustainability measures, rather than performance of the fisheries in relation to potential overall yield. While there is a growing consensus that single-species management should be replaced by an ecosystem-based approach, this will require clear legislative directives regarding management of the trade-offs involved.

It compares and contrasts interdisciplinary integration based on three criteria: inclusion of societal topics; the use of social science frameworks, theory, and literature to interpret findings; and processes of knowledge production. National and sub-national climate assessments serve different societal purposes and decision-making goals, and are produced in distinct knowledge governance contexts. While climate focused social sciences are increasingly incorporated into assessments, the nature of this incorporation varies across assessment types. The greatest advancements for interdisciplinary integration in the Fifth National Climate Assessment are in the robust treatment of economics, equity and environmental justice, and social systems and the addition of core concepts to the climate lexicon. In sub-national assessments, alternative organizational formats open up space to examine climate-society interactions for sectoral or geographic topics of interest. However, their analysis often is limited to vulnerability mapping and dollar values instead of the broader social and economic systems that shape climate drivers, hazards, impacts, and responses. Most social sciences are present in climate impacts chapters. There is opportunity to engage additional social science in analysis of climate hazards, drivers of climate change, mitigation and adaptation efforts, and the underlying social causes of vulnerability. Better integration of the social and biogeophysical sciences can help assessments expand the language of climate response and universe of potential interventions, enabling them to inform decision-making at national to local scales.},

While methods for assessing the vulnerability of species to climate change are rapidly developing4 and socio-ecological vulnerability assessments for fisheries are becoming available5, there has been less work devoted to understanding how impacts differ across fishing communities. We developed a linked socio-ecological approach to assess the exposure of fishing communities to risk from climate change, and present a case study of New England and Mid-Atlantic (USA) fishing communities. We found that the northern part of the study region was projected to gain suitable habitat and the southern part projected to lose suitable habitat for many species, but the exposure of fishing communities to risk was strongly dependent on both their spatial use of the ocean and their portfolio of species caught. A majority of fishing communities were projected to face declining future fishing opportunities unless they adapt, either through catching new species or fishing in new locations. By integrating climatic, ecological and socio-economic data at a scale relevant to fishing communities, this analysis identifies where strategies for adapting to the ecological impacts of climate change will be most needed.},

	abstract = {The uncertainty of future ocean conditions caused by climate change challenges the conventional fisheries management model that assumes resource extraction occurs in a steady-state environment. As managers respond to climate impacts and focus on long-term preparedness, an overarching goal is to minimize the vulnerability of fishing businesses and communities. However, during the adaptation process, challenges can arise when perceptions of climate change vulnerability differ among scientists, managers, and harvesters. A harvester's perception of their risk to climate change influences their willingness to plan for and respond to change, yet these views are often overlooked in adaptation planning. To better understand this dynamic, we conducted a regional survey to evaluate the perceptions harvesters hold regarding the impacts of climate change on commercially fished species in the Northeastern United States and the resulting risks from those changes. The waters in this region of the Northwest Atlantic shelf are warming faster than the global average resulting in shifting distributions of species, altered seasonal migrations, and changes in productivity. Respondents' perceptions aligned with an analysis conducted by scientists on the directionality of climate impacts for 12 out of 27 (44\%) of the most commercially important species in the region. Additionally, an understanding of the variability in perceptions of climate change vulnerability emerged: 72\% of respondents believe climate change is occurring, 53\% believe climate change will harm them personally, and 28\% have already seen a negative impact on their ability to catch fish. Respondents who believe that climate change is occurring had higher perceptions of vulnerability on average than those who do not believe it is occurring. Despite a sense of vulnerability to climate change, respondents did not rank it among the top three concerns (fisheries regulations, market access, and access to working waterfronts) for their fishing businesses. Investigating harvester’s perceptions is an opportunity to share their experiences and understand the diversity of perspectives regarding the impacts of climate change. Increasing the inclusion of social science indicators and diverse perspectives will increase climate resilience of fisheries management.},

	abstract = {Understanding how abundance, productivity and distribution of individual species may respond to climate change is a critical first step towards anticipating alterations in marine ecosystem structure and function, as well as developing strategies to adapt to the full range of potential changes. This study applies the NOAA Fisheries Climate Vulnerability Assessment method to 64 federally-managed species in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem to assess their vulnerability to climate change, where vulnerability is a function of a species’ exposure to environmental change and its biological sensitivity to a set of environmental conditions, which includes components of its resiliency and adaptive capacity to respond to these new conditions. Overall, two-thirds of the species were judged to have Moderate or greater vulnerability to climate change, and only one species was anticipated to have a positive response. Species classified as Highly or Very Highly vulnerable share one or more characteristics including: 1) having complex life histories that utilize a wide range of freshwater and marine habitats; 2) having habitat specialization, particularly for areas that are likely to experience increased hypoxia; 3) having long lifespans with low population growth rates; and/or 4) being of high commercial value combined with impacts from non-climate stressors such as anthropogenic habitat degradation. Species with low or Moderate vulnerability are either habitat generalists, occupy deep-water habitats or are highly mobile and likely to shift their ranges. As climate-related changes intensify, this work provides key information for both scientists and managers as they address the long-term sustainability of fisheries in the region. This information will inform near-term advice for prioritizing species-level data collection and research on climate impacts , help managers to determine when and where a precautionary approach might be warranted, in harvest or other management decisions, and help identify habitats or life history stages that might be especially important to protect or restore},

	abstract = {Understanding and anticipating the effects of climate change on fisheries social-ecological systems (FSESs) is central to proactive fisheries management in a changing global climate. With fisheries management increasingly striving to consider interactions and feedbacks among people, targeted species, and the broader ecological and human communities, fisheries managers and participants need tools to help them assess these complex systems. We developed a new climate vulnerability assessment framework for analyzing the impacts of a climate-induced trend or event on a FSES. The framework divides the FSES into four interrelated and interacting domains: Ecological Community, Fished Species, Fishery, and Human Community. The framework provides a systematic approach to account for indirect as well as direct effects, links among subsystems, and multiple climate change-induced stressors. We demonstrate the framework’s utility by applying it to three case studies: the effects of a marine heatwave on the Dungeness crab FSES, the effects of a marine heatwave on the red sea urchin FSES, and the effects of long-term climate trends on North Pacific albacore. We found that the effects of a climatic trend or event on a FSES are often indirect and can trigger diverse and important feedbacks. These examples also showed that the climatic trend or event may cause changes in the temporal and spatial distribution of fishing effort and fished species that have a more significant impact on the FSES than changes to species abundance per se. Unlike other climate vulnerability assessment frameworks and applications, ours is designed to enable consideration of the range of feedbacks within and among both the ecological and human communities. As such, it is a valuable tool to guide the holistic examination and assessment of potential impacts to FSESs.},

	abstract = {From fishers to farmers, people across the planet who rely directly upon natural resources for their livelihoods and well-being face extensive impacts from climate change. However, local- and regional-scale impacts and associated risks can vary geographically, and the implications for development of adaptation pathways that will be most effective for specific communities are underexplored. To improve this understanding at relevant local scales, we developed a coupled social-ecological approach to assess the risk posed to fishing fleets by climate change, applying it to a case study of groundfish fleets that are a cornerstone of fisheries along the U.S. West Coast. Based on the mean of three high-resolution climate projections, we found that more poleward fleets may experience twice as much local temperature change as equatorward fleets, and 3–4 times as much depth displacement of historical environmental conditions in their fishing grounds. Not only are they more highly exposed to climate change, but some poleward fleets are {\textgreater}10x more economically-dependent on groundfish. While we show clear regional differences in fleets’ flexibility to shift to new fisheries via fisheries diversification (‘adapt in-place’) or shift their fishing grounds in response to future change through greater mobility (‘adapt on-the-move’), these differences do not completely mitigate the greater exposure and economic dependence of more poleward fleets. Therefore, on the U.S. West Coast more poleward fishing fleets may be at greater overall risk due to climate change, in contrast to expectations for greater equatorward risk in other parts of the world. Through integration of climatic, ecological, and socio-economic data, this case study illustrates the potential for widespread implementation of risk assessment at scales relevant to fishers, communities, and decision makers. Such applications will help identify the greatest opportunities to mitigate climate risks through pathways that enhance flexibility and other dimensions of adaptive capacity.},

Federal laws required social impact assessment of fishery management plans, use of ecosystem-based management, and taking into account the impacts to fishers and fishing communities of both of these. But laws provide overarching guidance and policy documents need to refine the focus for research. I led the working group that wrote this guidance for fishing communities. Multidisciplinary teams of social and natural scientists today continue refining our understanding of the connections of communities to fisheries, whether commercial, recreational, or subsistence – or some combination. I also helped to develop a conceptual model for the Northeast Region ecosystem, and led an oral history research project examining the implementation across Europe of a NOAA Fisheries process model for ecosystem assessment. Although the hiring of anthropologists, sociologists, and others has become normalized, we are still few in number nationwide, so more work remains to be done.},

	abstract = {Marine social–ecological systems are constantly changing, and fishers who make a living from working the seas are continually adapting in response to different sources of variability. One main way in which fishers can adapt to ecosystem change is to change the fisheries they participate in. This acts to connect fisheries, creating interlinked networks of alternative sources of income for fishers. Here, we synthesize fisheries data and construct fisheries connectivity networks for all major ports in the US California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. Fisheries connectivity networks are comprised of nodes, which are fisheries, connected by edges, whose weights are proportional to the number of participating vessels. Fisheries connectivity networks identify central fisheries in the US California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, specifically Dungeness crab and Spiny Lobster, and systematic topological differences, e.g. in network resilience and modularity. These network metrics directly relate to the social vulnerability of coastal fishing communities, especially their sensitivity and capacity to adapt to perturbation. Ultimately, improving knowledge of fisheries connectivity is vital if policy makers are to create governance institutions that allow fishermen to adapt to environmental, technological and management change while at the same time enhancing the social and economic value of fisheries. In doing so, new policies that account for fisheries connectivity, will lead to improved sustainable fisheries management, and enhanced socioeconomic resilience of coastal communities.},

Here, we examined trends in the distribution and biomass of five commercial target species (dover sole, thornyheads, sablefish, lingcod, and petrale sole) on the US west coast to determine how their availability to fishing ports changed over 40 years. We show that the timing and magnitude of stock declines and recoveries are not experienced uniformly along the coast when they coincide with shifts in species distributions. For example, overall stock availability of sablefish was more stable in southern latitudes where a 40\% regional decline in biomass was counterbalanced by a southward shift in distribution of \&gt;200 km since 2003. Greater vessel mobility and larger areal extent of fish habitat along the continental shelf buffered northerly ports from latitudinal changes in stock availability. Landings were not consistently related to stock availability, suggesting that social, economic, and regulatory factors likely constrain or facilitate the capacity for fishers to adapt to changes in fish availability. Coupled social–ecological analyses such as the one presented here are important for defining community vulnerability to current and future changes in the availability of important marine species.},

Subjective adaptive capacity to changes in the fishery in general and those caused by natural disasters was assessed. A comparison between commercial and for-hire fishermen revealed important differences and similarities with regard to attributes influencing their perceived adaptive capacity. While both groups show high levels of coping capacity in general, for-hire fishermen presented more confidence in their ability to obtain work and income outside the fishery while commercial fishermen were more confident in their ability to remain in fishing. For both groups, those that suffered more intense impacts from the storm had more negative levels of perceived adaptive capacity. Understanding the perceived adaptive capacity of commercial and for-hire fishermen can help researchers and policy makers better understand and address each sector’s response to impacts of future natural disasters and human driven changes.},

Exploring factors that constrain or facilitate the adaptation process in complex fisheries socio-ecological systems can enable greater insight into why certain adaptation strategies may succeed or fail and help inform adaptation planning. Using data collected from interviews and workshops in four commercial fishing communities in New England along the Northeast US coastline, we ask what barriers and enablers of climate adaptation are being experienced or perceived, and where within the fisheries socio-ecological system they are emerging. Thematic analysis identified a variety of barriers and enablers of adaptation, of which many were shared across communities, while others were unique to particular localities. Barriers included fisheries specialisation and dependency, overcapitalisation, working waterfront issues, limited access to alternative fisheries, management system responsiveness, wider community perceptions, and workforce challenges. Enablers included perceived industry and community adaptability, knowledge and learning capacity, working waterfront protections, diverse shoreside services, and fisher-led conservation efforts. Barriers and enablers therefore arose not just among fishers themselves, but emerged throughout the socio-ecological system, highlighting the importance of multi-scale influences on adaptation processes. Climate adaptation planning in fisheries contexts should extend beyond approaches that consider the resource and resource user to also account for the changes, barriers and opportunities occurring shoreside and influencing the future of the fishing community as a whole.},

	abstract = {Understanding the dynamic relationship between marine species and their changing environments is critical for ecosystem based management, particularly as coastal ecosystems experience rapid change (e.g., general warming, marine heat waves). In this paper, we present a novel statistical approach to robustly estimate and track the thermal niches of 30 marine fishes along the west coast of North America. Leveraging three long-term fisheries-independent datasets, we use spatiotemporal modeling tools to capture spatiotemporal variation in species densities. Estimates from our models are then used to generate species-specific estimates of thermal niches through time at several scales: coastwide and for each of the three regions. By synthesizing data across regions and time scales, our modeling approach provides insights into how these marine species may be tracking or responding to changes in temperature. While we did not find evidence of consistent temperature-density relationships among regions, we are able to contrast differences across species: Dover sole and shortspine thornyhead have relatively broad thermal niche estimates that are static over time, whereas several semi-pelagic species (e.g., Pacific hake, walleye pollock) have niches that are both becoming warmer over time and simultaneously narrowing. This illustrates how several economically and ecologically valuable species are facing contrasting fates in a changing environment, with potential consequences for fisheries and ecosystems. Our modeling approach is flexible and can be easily extended to other species or ecosystems, as well as other environmental variables. Results from these models may be broadly useful to scientists, managers, and stakeholders—monitoring trends in the direction and variability of thermal niches may be useful in identifying species that are more susceptible to environmental change, and results of this work can form quantitative metrics that may be included in climate vulnerability assessments, estimation of dynamic essential fish habitat, and assessments of climate risk posed to fishing communities.},

Along with the Great Lakes, this vast area generates {\textasciitilde}US 370 billion of U.S. gross domestic product, 617 billion in sales and 2.6 million jobs each year. These ocean and coastal ecosystems also provide many important non-market services including subsistence food provisioning, health benefits, shoreline protection, climate regulation, conservation of marine biodiversity, and preservation of cultural heritage. As climatic changes occur, these benefits or ecosystem services may be significantly reduced or in some cases enhanced. These services are also under an array of pressures including over-exploitation of natural resources, pollution, and land use changes that occur simultaneously in synergistic, multiplicative, or antagonistic ways. This results in direct and indirect impacts that are often unpredictable across spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss a set of indicators designed in close collaboration with the U.S. National Climate Indicators System. Tracking the impacts via indicators will be essential to ensure long-term health of the marine environment and sustain the benefits to stakeholders who depend on marine ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Species are experiencing a suite of novel stressors from anthropogenic activities that have impacts at multiple scales. Vulnerability assessment is one tool to evaluate the likely impacts that these stressors pose to species so that high-vulnerability cases can be identified and prioritized for monitoring, protection, or mitigation. Commonly used semi-quantitative methods lack a framework to explicitly account for differences in exposure to stressors and organism responses across life stages. Here we propose a modification to commonly used spatial vulnerability assessment methods that includes such an approach, using ocean acidification in the California Current as an illustrative case study. Life stage considerations were included by assessing vulnerability of each life stage to ocean acidification and were used to estimate population vulnerability in two ways. We set population vulnerability equal to: (1) the maximum stage vulnerability and (2) a weighted mean across all stages, with weights calculated using Lefkovitch matrix models. Vulnerability was found to vary across life stages for the six species explored in this case study: two krill–Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera, pteropod–Limacina helicina, pink shrimp–Pandalus jordani, Dungeness crab–Metacarcinus magister and Pacific hake–Merluccius productus. The maximum vulnerability estimates ranged from larval to subadult and adult stages with no consistent stage having maximum vulnerability across species. Similarly, integrated vulnerability metrics varied greatly across species. A comparison showed that some species had vulnerabilities that were similar between the two metrics, while other species’ vulnerabilities varied substantially between the two metrics. These differences primarily resulted from cases where the most vulnerable stage had a low relative weight. We compare these methods and explore circumstances where each method may be appropriate.},

	abstract = {Motivated by a need for climate-informed living marine resource management, increased emphasis has been placed on regional end-to-end modeling frameworks designed to project climate impacts on marine ecosystems and evaluate the efficacy of potential management strategies under changing conditions. The ‘Future Seas’ project was initiated with a focus on three fisheries (Pacific sardine, swordfish, and albacore tuna) in the California Current System (CCS). This work leverages a suite of climate, ocean, ecosystem, and economic models to project physical, ecological, and socio-economic change, evaluate management strategies, and quantify uncertainty in model projections. Here we describe the components of the modeling framework, considerations underlying choices made in model development, engagement with stakeholders, and key physical, ecological, and socio-economic results to date, including projections to 2100. Our broad aims are to (i) synthesize a large body of climate and fisheries research that has been conducted, and continues, under the Future Seas umbrella, and (ii) provide insight and recommendations to those pursuing similar efforts for other applications and in other regions. In general, our results indicate that all three species will likely shift their distributions (predominantly poleward) in the future, which impacts accessibility to fishing fleets, spatial management, and quota allocation. For similar integrative climate-to-fisheries projections, we recommend attention is given to: recognizing potential biases arising from differences between the climate products used for ecological model fitting and those used for model projection; how sources of projection uncertainty are prioritized, incorporated, and communicated; and quantitatively linking scenarios – especially socio-economic scenarios – with climate and ecological projections.},

	abstract = {Developing a comprehensive portfolio of theoretically sound indicators is fundamental to effective place-based management of coastal ecosystems at a wide range of scales. We reviewed indicator development case studies from seven different social-ecological systems over the first 10 years of the NOAA integrated ecosystem assessment (IEA) program, with the goals of identifying effective strategies and highlighting general principles that would inform future efforts. The IEA framework provided a versatile approach to developing indicators across a diverse range of differently scaled systems and partnerships, guided by organizing principles of screening transparency, iterative review, and an adaptive balance between quantitative evaluation methods and qualitative stakeholder guidance. Information exchange across the broad community of EBM practitioners facilitated progress between systems, chronologically tracking a path that reflected improvements in indicator development methods (especially for social indicators) and a growing focus on multisector EBM in smaller coastal communities. Most projects adopted innovative visual imagery to engage partners and stakeholders, which built trust and communication while enhancing the spectrum of indicators. Using guidance from the lessons above, future indicator development efforts will be better prepared to confront the recurring, transdisciplinary challenges of managing integrated social-ecological systems.},

Management targets therefore need to incorporate these complex dynamics, which may be accomplished by establishing targets based on the indicators. Here, we leverage existing data to evaluate the use of indicators in EBFM for nearshore ecosystems in Hawai‘i. We screened for potential nonlinearities in the spatial relationships between ecosystem indicators and environmental drivers over a 10-year period, and assessed commonalities in identified indicator–driver thresholds. To understand how the ecosystem indicators relate to commonly used metrics in single-species assessments, we also tested whether these relationships were consistent across species, species complexes, and functional groups. Gradient forests and generalized additive mixed models revealed detectable threshold relationships across five environmental drivers and six ecosystem indicators. Several indicators showed considerable overlap in threshold locations with common drivers, especially for rugosity (habitat complexity) and wave forcing. While some indicators comprising nested species, species complexes, and functional groups had comparable thresholds with a common driver, this was not always the case, highlighting the need for careful consideration when selecting indicators for management applications. We demonstrate the use of these thresholds in environmental drivers by evaluating them along a gradient of fish biomass. The use of multi-model inference to incorporate multiple statistical methods to define the relationship between an ecosystem indicator and driver offers a quantitative basis for ecosystem management. Our results here provide a rubric by which to test for the existence of thresholds in indicator–driver relationships across spatial gradients and additionally identify clear thresholds for which to consider when managing fisheries.},

	abstract = {Despite progress in understanding and predicting climate change impacts and possible responses for US marine fisheries, use of climate-related information in federal fishery management decisions remains limited. One barrier to progress in linking climate knowledge to management action is that individual management bodies’ efforts tend to be isolated, with few opportunities to coordinate or communicate about successes and shared challenges. To promote cross-regional learning, we distill eight best practices from emerging climate-focused efforts, drawn from a collaborative workshop, literature, and authors’ experiences. We conceptualize these best practices as interrelated—and incomplete—pieces of a knowledge-to-action “puzzle” that could be adopted based on regional context. One best practice, mapping out management processes and structure to identify “on-ramps” for climate information (3.1), represents a foundational centerpiece that enables other best practices. Three practices apply primarily to internal management processes: frame climate initiatives within existing management mandates and processes (3.2); strategically incorporate qualitative information to deal with uncertainty (3.3); and pilot initiatives with healthy or lower-risk stocks (3.4). Another set pertains to efforts that include broader stakeholders: engage stakeholders early and often (3.5), emphasize local priorities (3.6), employ structured processes to keep initiatives on track (3.7), and leverage collaborative research to build trust and overcome capacity constraints (3.8). We highlight emerging initiatives that demonstrate how these practices were implemented, discuss continued challenges, and identify opportunities where these practices could be expanded in support of climate-ready fisheries.},

This study considers the Gulf of Maine ecosystem, a region of high social and ecological importance in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and synthesizes current knowledge of (a) key seasonal processes, patterns, and events; (b) direct evidence for shifts in timing; (c) implications of phenological responses for linked ecological-human systems; and (d) potential phenology-focused adaptation strategies and actions. Twenty studies demonstrated shifts in timing of regional marine organisms and seasonal environmental events. The most common response was earlier timing, observed in spring onset, spring and winter hydrology, zooplankton abundance, occurrence of several larval fishes, and diadromous fish migrations. Later timing was documented for fall onset, reproduction and fledging in Atlantic puffins, spring and fall phytoplankton blooms, and occurrence of additional larval fishes. Changes in event duration generally increased and were detected in zooplankton peak abundance, early life history periods of macro-invertebrates, and lobster fishery landings. Reduced duration was observed in winter–spring ice-affected stream flows. Two studies projected phenological changes, both finding diapause duration would decrease in zooplankton under future climate scenarios. Phenological responses were species-specific and varied depending on the environmental driver, spatial, and temporal scales evaluated. Overall, a wide range of baseline phenology and relevant modeling studies exist, yet surprisingly few document long-term shifts. Results reveal a need for increased emphasis on phenological shifts in the Gulf of Maine and identify opportunities for future research and consideration of phenological changes in adaptation efforts.},

	abstract = {Science-based natural resource management is necessary for agencies to effectively meet their goals and mandates. However, this scientific basis needs to be advanced and evolved with ecosystems experiencing unprecedented events that challenge conventional management frameworks. Effectively managing marine resources and achieving agency missions requires more than meeting independent mandates and managing individual resources as chronic stressors overwhelm conventional management frameworks. Global science organizations are transitioning to interdisciplinary and holistic research to integrate human well-being as a key outcome. The United States’ principal federal agency tasked with managing coastal and marine ecosystems is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA’s vision is “healthy ecosystems, communities and economies that are resilient in the face of change”. NOAA adopted the Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) approach to conduct the collaborative science necessary for ecosystem-based management. IEAs have been employed for over a decade to develop science, tools, and collaborations that address complex ecosystem challenges and make progress toward NOAA’s vision. This paper demonstrates, through case studies, how scientists, stakeholders, and managers build trust and meaningful relationships from the IEA approach. These case studies further demonstrate how the IEA approach can be adapted to various geographic and management scales to build trust with partners and provide the ecosystem science, including social science, required to build resilient coastal ecosystems, communities, and economies.},

Moreover, virtually no data exists that tracks the characteristics of crew and hired captains over time in order to capture trends in socio-demographics, employment, and fishing practices, among other factors. This study is a follow-up to a baseline survey conducted in 2012 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC). During late 2018 and early 2019, NEFSC staff conducted interviews with commercial fishing vessel crew and hired captains at ports from Maine to North Carolina. Interviewers asked respondents questions regarding their demographic background, the availability of work, and fishing trip characteristics, among other topics of interest related to employment in commercial fishing. Results indicate an increasing fragility of fishing communities in the region related to the aging of fishing crews and low levels of new individuals entering into the occupation, in addition to other social and economic vulnerabilities of commercial crews and hired captains.},

As a result, conservation and resource management increasingly look to factor in potential interactions among the social, ecological and economic components of these systems. Investigation of these interactions requires interdisciplinary frameworks that incorporate methods and insights from across the social and biophysical sciences. Risk assessment methods, which have been developed across numerous disciplines and applied to various real-world settings and problems, provide a unique connection point for cross-disciplinary engagement. However, research on risk is often conducted in distinct spheres by experts whose focus is on narrow sources or outcomes of risk. Movement towards a more integrated treatment of risk to ensure a balanced approach to developing and managing ocean resources requires cross-disciplinary engagement and understanding. Here, we provide a primer on risk assessment intended to encourage the development and implementation of integrated risk assessment processes in the emerging blue economy. First, we summarize the dominant framework for risk in the ecological / biophysical sciences. Then, we discuss six key insights from the long history of risk research in the social sciences that can inform integrated assessments of risk: 1) consider the subjective nature of risk, 2) understand individual social and cultural influences on risk perceptions, 3) include diverse expertise, 4) consider the social scales of analysis, 5) incorporate quantitative and qualitative approaches, and 6) understand interactions and feedbacks within systems. Finally, we show how these insights can be incorporated into risk assessment and management, and apply them to a case study of whale entanglements in fishing gear off the U.S. west coast.},

	abstract = {Our changing climate poses growing challenges for effective management of marine life, ocean ecosystems, and human communities. Which species are most vulnerable to climate change, and where should management focus efforts to reduce these risks? To address these questions, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries Climate Science Strategy called for vulnerability assessments in each of NOAA’s ocean regions. The Pacific Islands Vulnerability Assessment (PIVA) project assessed the susceptibility of 83 marine species to the impacts of climate change projected to 2055. In a standard Rapid Vulnerability Assessment framework, this project applied expert knowledge, literature review, and climate projection models to synthesize the best available science towards answering these questions. Here we: (1) provide a relative climate vulnerability ranking across species; (2) identify key attributes and factors that drive vulnerability; and (3) identify critical data gaps in understanding climate change impacts to marine life. The invertebrate group was ranked most vulnerable and pelagic and coastal groups not associated with coral reefs were ranked least vulnerable. Sea surface temperature, ocean acidification, and oxygen concentration were the main exposure drivers of vulnerability. Early Life History Survival and Settlement Requirements was the most data deficient of the sensitivity attributes considered in the assessment. The sensitivity of many coral reef fishes ranged between Low and Moderate, which is likely underestimated given that reef species depend on a biogenic habitat that is extremely threatened by climate change. The standard assessment methodology originally developed in the Northeast US, did not capture the additional complexity of the Pacific region, such as the diversity, varied horizontal and vertical distributions, extent of coral reef habitats, the degree of dependence on vulnerable habitat, and wide range of taxa, including data-poor species. Within these limitations, this project identified research needs to sustain marine life in a changing climate.},

	abstract = {Trait-based climate vulnerability assessments based on expert evaluation have emerged as a rapid tool to assess biological vulnerability when detailed correlative or mechanistic studies are not feasible. Trait-based assessments typically view vulnerability as a combination of sensitivity and exposure to climate change. However, in some locations, a substantial amount of information may exist on system productivity and environmental conditions (both current and projected), with potential disparities in the information available for data-rich and data-poor stocks. Incorporating this level of detailed information poses challenges when conducting, and communicating uncertainty from, rapid vulnerability assessments. We applied a trait-based vulnerability assessment to 36 fish and invertebrate stocks in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), a data-rich ecosystem. In recent years, the living marine resources of the EBS and Aleutian Islands have supported fisheries worth more than US \$1 billion of annual ex-vessel value. Our vulnerability assessment uses projections (to 2039) from three downscaled climate models, and graphically characterizes the variation in climate projections between climate models and between seasons. Bootstrapping was used to characterize uncertainty in specific biological traits and environmental variables, and in the scores for sensitivity, exposure, and vulnerability. The sensitivity of EBS stocks to climate change ranged from “low” to “high,” but vulnerability ranged between “low” and “moderate” due to limited exposure to climate change. Comparison with more detailed studies reveals that water temperature is an important variable for projecting climate impacts on stocks such as walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), and sensitivity analyses revealed that modifying the rule for determining vulnerability increased the vulnerability scores. This study demonstrates the importance of considering several uncertainties (e.g., climate projections, biological, and model structure) when conducting climate vulnerability assessments, and can be extended in future research to consider the vulnerability of user groups dependent on these stocks.},

	abstract = {Climate change and climate variability are affecting marine mammal species and these impacts are projected to continue in the coming decades. Vulnerability assessments provide a framework for evaluating climate impacts over a broad range of species using currently available information. We conducted a trait-based climate vulnerability assessment using expert elicitation for 108 marine mammal stocks and stock groups in the western North Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. Our approach combined the exposure (projected change in environmental conditions) and sensitivity (ability to tolerate and adapt to changing conditions) of marine mammal stocks to estimate vulnerability to climate change, and categorize stocks with a vulnerability index. The climate vulnerability score was very high for 44\% (n = 47) of these stocks, high for 29\% (n = 31), moderate for 20\% (n = 22), and low for 7\% (n = 8). The majority of stocks (n = 78; 72\%) scored very high exposure, whereas 24\% (n = 26) scored high, and 4\% (n = 4) scored moderate. The sensitivity score was very high for 33\% (n = 36) of these stocks, high for 18\% (n = 19), moderate for 34\% (n = 37), and low for 15\% (n = 16). Vulnerability results were summarized for stocks in five taxonomic groups: pinnipeds (n = 4; 25\% high, 75\% moderate), mysticetes (n = 7; 29\% very high, 57\% high, 14\% moderate), ziphiids (n = 8; 13\% very high, 50\% high, 38\% moderate), delphinids (n = 84; 52\% very high, 23\% high, 15\% moderate, 10\% low), and other odontocetes (n = 5; 60\% high, 40\% moderate). Factors including temperature, ocean pH, and dissolved oxygen were the primary drivers of high climate exposure, with effects mediated through prey and habitat parameters. We quantified sources of uncertainty by bootstrapping vulnerability scores, conducting leave-one-out analyses of individual attributes and individual scorers, and through scoring data quality for each attribute. These results provide information for researchers, managers, and the public on marine mammal responses to climate change to enhance the development of more effective marine mammal management, restoration, and conservation activities that address current and future environmental variation and biological responses due to climate change.},

Climate change may rapidly threaten sustainability, and recognizing these instances is important for effective climate adaptation. Here, we present one approach for evaluating changing sustainability under a changing climate. We use Bayesian regression models to compare fish population processes under historical climate norms and emerging anthropogenic extremes. To define anthropogenic extremes we use the Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR), which estimates the proportion of risk for extreme ocean temperatures that can be attributed to human influence. We illustrate our approach with estimates of recruitment (production of young fish, a key determinant of sustainability) for two exploited fishes (Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus and walleye pollock G. chalcogrammus) in a rapidly warming ecosystem, the Gulf of Alaska. We show that recruitment distributions for both species have shifted towards zero during anthropogenic climate extremes. Predictions based on the projected incidence of anthropogenic temperature extremes indicate that expected recruitment, and therefore fisheries sustainability, is markedly lower in the current climate than during recent decades. Using FAR to analyze changing population processes may help fisheries managers and stakeholders to recognize situations when historical sustainability expectations should be reevaluated.},

In this study, we developed and analyzed stakeholder-driven conceptual models with seven different stakeholder groups in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands to assess and compare their perceptions of the fishery ecosystem. Conceptual models were developed for each stakeholder group during 29 separate workshops involving a total of 236 participants representing Commercial Fishers, Managers, Academics, Local Businesses, Environmental NGOs, and the Caribbean Fishery Management Council (CFMC) District Advisory Panels (DAPs) and Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC). Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS) and two-mode social network analysis were used to investigate differences and similarities between stakeholder groups as well as to identify priority ecosystem elements and threats. Results show important variations between stakeholders and islands in terms of their perceived importance of ecosystem components and relationships, which supports the need for collaborative approaches and co-production of knowledge in the United States (U.S.) Caribbean region. Despite this variation, important areas of common concern among stakeholders were identified such as: habitat integrity (e.g., coral reefs), water quality, and influence of recreational fisheries and tourism on marine ecosystems. Findings of this study support the use of stakeholder-driven conceptual models as effective tools to guide decision-making, aid prioritization of data collection, and increase collaboration and cooperation among stakeholders in the context of fisheries management.},

The fishing intensity of developed countries peaked in 1997 and has since fallen due to management, but developing countries’ fishing intensity has increased continuously over the whole research period, with quasi-linear growth after 1980. Africa has experienced the most rapid expansion in fishing activity and now has the highest fishing intensity. This index takes a more comprehensive and objective look at fisheries. Its worldwide spatial–temporal comparison enables the identification of similar temporal trends across countries or regions, as well as areas of uneven development and hotspot sites for targeted policy action.},

              Ecosystem‐based fisheries management strives to account for species interactions and ecosystem processes in natural resource management and conservation. In this context, ecosystem‐wide caps on total fishery catches have been proposed as one tool to manage multispecies fisheries with an ecosystem approach. However, determining effective ecosystem caps is complicated because fish stock production is influenced by environmental conditions, species interactions, and fishing. Consequently, the implementation of ecosystem caps in fisheries management frameworks remains uncommon. We investigated whether ecosystem caps should account for climate variability and for predator–prey dynamics to achieve management objectives in complex marine ecosystems. We considered the example of the Gulf of Alaska (United States), a North Pacific large marine ecosystem where annual groundfish catches are managed using an “optimum yield” ecosystem cap of 800,000 t. We simulated multispecies yield of the 12 most abundant and commercially valuable groundfish stocks under selected climate and fishing scenarios using an end‐to‐end marine ecosystem model (Atlantis), which accounts for predator–prey and ecosystem dynamics. We found that total groundfish yield was never projected to exceed the 800,000 mt optimum yield cap across scenarios and fishing mortalities. Projected climate change led to decreased groundfish yield, and predation from the underexploited groundfish predator arrowtooth flounder (
              
                Atheresthes stomias
              
              ) led to foregone catches. Groundfish removals had negative indirect effects on groundfish predators, despite total yield never exceeding the optimum yield cap, highlighting that an ineffective cap may not protect non‐target species. These results suggest that the optimum yield cap currently used in the Gulf of Alaska may be too high to constrain groundfish catches under future climate change and low exploitation rates of predators. We propose that ecosystem caps should be reviewed when environmental conditions, stock productivity, or species interactions change.},

The marine ecosystem currently faces numerous threats that undermine ecosystem integrity and compromise socially valuable ecosystem services. The socio-economic and ecological complexity of the region invokes a clear need for ecosystem-based management (EBM) strategies. To support EBM development, participatory methods were used to gather expert and place-based knowledge from resource managers, scientists, and community members. Methods elicited local values, fostered diverse relationships, and increased community engagement in resource management. Using information collected, Conceptual ecosystemmodels were developed guided by the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework that identify and quantify the strength of socio-economic and ecological interactions. The resulting models illustrate the complexity of system dynamics, highlighting connectivity between pressures and the ecosystem, with direct implications for ecosystem services. Importantly, many identified pressures occur at the local scale, presenting an opportunity for local resource management to directly affect ecosystem status. This study also found that many of the strongly impacted ecosystem services were cultural ecosystem services, which are critical to human well-being but lack integration into resource management. These models support an Integrated Ecosystem Assessment of the region by informing ecosystem-based strategies, facilitating the selection of ecosystem monitoring indicators, and emphasizing human dimensions.},

	abstract = {An Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profile (ESP) was used as a framework to address TOR1 in this research track assessment. ESP is a standardized framework to facilitate the inclusion of ecosystem and socioeconomic information in the stock advice process; it leverages existing information to understand the ecological and socio-economic drivers of stock dynamics and to incorporate this diverse information into the stock advice process through the creation of ecosystem and socioeconomic indicators. This standard framework also facilitates the interpretation of data and allows future working groups to update the existing indicators in addition to creating and assessing new indicators. The ESP process begins with (1) a systematic review of existing ecosystem and socioeconomic literature and identification of problem statements for the stock, followed by (2) development of conceptual models to outline the major drivers on the stock, (3) creation of indicators relevant to stock performance, (4) analysis of select indicators, and, lastly, (5) reporting out scientific advice. The scientific advice provided by an ESP can come at multiple levels of complexity, ranging from providing additional context and research recommendations, to suggesting new covariates to include as covariates to inform assessment modeling. The bluefish ESP includes a comprehensive literature review of bluefish life history and related ecosystem considerations relating to bluefish habitat, distribution, diet, predators, competitors, growth, and survival at each life stage, as well as a review of the history of the bluefish stock assessment and relevant biological information that is used to make decisions relating to the assessment modeling. Diet data collected from multiple scientific surveys were analyzed to determine the major prey and predators of bluefish, supplementing the literature review with the most recent data. Distributional and environmental data from multiple state and federal surveys were analyzed to understand where, when, and under what conditions bluefish of multiple life stages and size classes were found. Ecosystem and socioeconomic indicators were developed to better understand metrics of ecosystem and socioeconomic status, as well as to begin to probe potential mechanistic linkages between the environment and the status of the bluefish stock.},

	abstract = {In recognition of the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems worldwide, integrated research teams have coupled climate change projections with social-ecological models to inform management and evaluate adaptation strategies for the fishing industry and fishing communities. A key step in this process is the selection of scenarios that enable improved adaptation strategies and decision-making through engagements with constituents with diverse interests in the future use of marine resources. This paper presents an approach to selecting and refining climate-informed social-ecological scenarios for groundfish and crab fisheries in the eastern Bering Sea. The approach involved: (a) initial model development to provide worked examples; (b) engagement with stakeholders to seek input on climate-related concerns, priorities, and adaptation options; and (c) establishment of pathways for uptake of climate-informed decision support information into existing management systems. This approach narrowed the range of candidate scenarios, identified pressing climate concerns of constituents, and clarified timelines for scheduling modeling projects to address these concerns. Separating evaluation of management strategies (research modeling) from proposed changes to Fishery Management Plans preserved opportunities for public debate of proposed changes through a well-established regulatory review process. Collectively, these outcomes help to advance the development of a regionally relevant climate-ready harvest policy.},

	abstract = {Fisheries stock assessments are the backbone of fisheries management in the United States. While a stock assessment model provides scientific estimates of stock status and overfishing limits, the broader process involves decisions about which data are collected, how the model is structured, and the social and economic effects of implementing the quota advice. Despite growing recognition that ecosystem and socioeconomic factors strongly influence fish stocks and fisheries, these drivers remain underrepresented in the assessment process. In the current period of rapid global change, environmental disturbances and anthropogenic impacts are increasing in frequency and intensity, escalating the need for stock assessments to explore and account for the complex dynamics among fish stocks, fisheries, and social systems. In our research, we illustrate how participatory conceptual modeling can improve the entire stock assessment to management process by identifying data gaps, elucidating changes in fishing activity and human behavior over time, providing context to help explain model uncertainty and improve model parameterization, and describing feedback loops and unintended consequences of management actions. A case study from the Gulf of America red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) fishery is used to illustrate the benefits of this methodology. Encouraging participatory conceptual modeling alongside future stock assessments would greatly increase our understanding of the socio-ecological feedbacks that are often critical to management success, and help determine how best to manage fisheries through an ever changing environmental and human landscape.},

	abstract = {The California Current ecosystem is highly dynamic at interannual to interdecadal time scales. Variability has been documented in pelagic and other fish species, but climate change may be altering the historical models of variation. This study investigates changes in productivity of 31 fish stocks in the California Current ecosystem. Productivity was measured from recent stock assessments, as the per-capita recruitment rate, estimated with a dynamic stock-recruitment model. Contrary to expectations, the dynamic stock-recruitment model fit better than the corresponding stationary model for only seven of the 31 stocks. There was little evidence of linear drift in productivity that might be expected to result from climate change. Climate variables improved forecast accuracy for a few stocks, but there was no common climate signal in productivity. One explanation of these results is that most of the west coast stocks are above their biomass levels for maximum sustainable yield, making them less susceptible to environmental variation. On the other hand, the dynamic recruitment models improved short-term forecasts for all stocks, which may be useful for quota setting. Finally, results for the subset of stocks with dynamic recruitment models could be used to establish dynamic biological reference points.},

	abstract = {Fishers often target multiple species. More diverse harvest portfolios may reduce income risk, increasing resilience to climate-driven changes in target species’ spatial distributions and availability. Moreover, different effects can be observed across vessels in response to the same shocks and stressors, as fishers are heterogeneous. Evaluation of climate risk across different vessel groups within a particular fishery requires consideration of heterogeneous climate impacts on the availability of multiple target species and how such changes may impact substitution behavior. Here we analyze how historical climate-driven changes in forage species distribution and the closure of the Pacific sardine fishery affected landings per vessel of three coastal pelagic species (CPS): Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) targeted by the U.S. West Coast CPS fleet from 2000 to 2020. Using cluster analysis, we grouped vessels into different fleet segments and estimated heterogeneous responses by fleet segment and port area. Our results show that considering heterogeneity is essential in the development of equitable and effective adaptation policies designed to mitigate the impact of changes on species availability in these fisheries.},

	abstract = {Cap-based time-area closures can reduce the incidental capture of specific non-target species in fisheries by temporarily closing fishing areas when bycatch exceeds a threshold. The displacement of fishing effort can result in bycatch tradeoffs by increasing interactions with other species or even negate the intended effect of the closure. Here, we assessed the change in bycatch risk for a suite of species of concern resulting from the Southern Exclusion Zone (SEZ), a 343 796 km2 bycatch cap-based time-area closure designed to protect false killer whales from mortality and serious injury in the Hawaiʻi deep-set longline fishery. The SEZ was enacted twice between 2018 and 2020. We found that during the SEZ closures, fishing effort increased along the eastern and southern SEZ border, where species like oceanic whitetip sharks, giant manta rays, and olive ridley sea turtles showed the most concentrated risk, indicating high susceptibility to overlap with displaced effort. Scalloped hammerhead sharks and green and leatherback sea turtles faced moderate risk near heavy fishing, while loggerhead turtles and false killer whales showed diffuse risk. These results highlight that while cap-based closures aim to protect a single species, effective Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management should consider the entire species portfolio in conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {Area-based restrictions on the use of fishing gears is one of many tools to conserve ecosystems and biodiversity in U.S. waters as well as internationally. We defined the term ‘marine fisheries conservation area’ and created an inventory of areas that restrict fishing activities, most of which were established by the U.S. Fishery Management Councils under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA). We identified 648 areas which currently cover 72 \% of the total U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). 531 areas, representing 56 \% of the EEZ, were classified as Ecosystem Conservation Areas that directly provide in situ conservation of biodiversity. Bottom trawling is prohibited year-round in 56 \% of the EEZ, and all bottom tending gear is prohibited year-round in 37 \%. Other fishing gears are prohibited in 60 \% of the EEZ year-round. Thus, a majority of the U.S. EEZ is conserved from the most environmentally adverse fishing activities. These focused geographic areas complement other management tools used to ensure sustainable fisheries and ecosystems, such as catch and bycatch limits and limitations on legal gears, which are often deployed at regional scales. Collectively, these measures meet objectives and MSA National Standards and promote the maintenance of biological productivity and biodiversity, while balancing ecosystem function with services that benefit our nation, such as access to nature through recreational opportunities and healthy, sustainable seafood for consumers. The strength of fisheries management in the U.S. is the ability to balance the diverse needs of the nation with the need for a healthy marine ecosystem.},

Here we present a case study from the U.S. West Coast, the stakeholder review of NOAA’s annual ecosystem status report for the California Current Ecosystem established by the Pacific Fisheries Management Council’s Fisheries Ecosystem Plan, showcasing a process to identify management priorities that require information from ecosystem models and analyses. We then assess potential ecosystem models and analyses that could help address the identified policy concerns. We screened stakeholder comments and found 17 comments highlighting the need for ecosystem-level synthesis. Policy needs for ecosystem science included: 1) assessment of how the environment affects productivity of target species to improve forecasts of biomass and reference points required for setting harvest limits, 2) assessment of shifts in the spatial distribution of target stocks and protected species to anticipate changes in availability and the potential for interactions between target and protected species, 3) identification of trophic interactions to better assess tradeoffs in the management of forage species between the diet needs of dependent predators, the resilience of fishing communities, and maintenance of the forage species themselves, and 4) synthesis of how the environment affects efficiency and profitability in fishing communities, either directly via extreme events (e.g. storms) or indirectly via climate-driven changes in target species availability. We conclude by exemplifying an existing management process established on the U.S. West Coast that could be used to enable the structured, iterative, and interactive communication between managers, stakeholders, and modellers that is key to refining existing ecosystem models and analyses for management use.},

	abstract = {Fisheries in Puerto Rico and the United States (US) Virgin Islands are predominately dependent on nearshore coral reef ecosystems and have suffered from historical overfishing. The unique characteristics of reef fisheries, including strong habitat dependence, susceptibility to coastal impacts, diffuse landing sites and strong multispecies and multigear interactions suggest that standard approaches to fisheries management, especially those typically considered by the US Regional Fishery Management Councils, would not be applicable. Current management authority is split between local and federal agencies; however, there exists no uniform context and direction to current management initiatives, which results in lost efficiencies and opportunities. Proposed here is a new vision for fisheries management that takes into consideration the local ecological and socioeconomic characteristics of fishing, is compatible with regional resources and capacity, is ecosystem based and targets full stakeholder participation. Only an ecosystem-based approach can lead fisheries management out of the trap of unrealistic data collection and analysis demands, while at the same time refocusing emphasis away from attitudes and practices that promote overfishing. Management must be based on first principles regarding the desired state of the ecosystem and initiate strategies based on these principles. The key management goal is not to maximize fisheries catch, but to maintain the ecosystem in a state that will lead to sustained production. First principles would include maintaining ecosystem integrity and function, protecting all habitats and water quality, applying the precautionary approach, monitoring reference points and recognizing that production has limits. Resulting management tactics include marine reserves (to meet multiple goals), closed spawning aggregations, gear restrictions to maintain trophic balance and habitats, targeted data collection and assessments, adopting co-management practices and using ecosystem or community-based metrics. Fisheries management must fully incorporate the tools, resources and methods available within coastal zone management and other environmental agencies, while standards within those programmes must protect ecosystem health. Implementation will require attending to structural barriers inherent within existing fisheries legislation and regulations, multiple jurisdictions and the current cultures of scientists, managers and fisherfolk. Initial efforts should focus on developing a common language and frame of reference for all stakeholders.},
