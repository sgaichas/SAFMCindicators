# Objectives

1) Review the different types of ecosystem data and information including data products and
decision-support tools (e.g. Ecosystem Status Reports, Climate Vulnerability Assessments, risk
assessments) currently available to the regional management councils and evaluate how they are
used in council management processes;

2) Identify opportunities and methods for incorporating identified ecosystem information into
SAFMC management processes, including inter-jurisdictional management decision-making
processes, and identify practical requirements for successful implementation (e.g. data quality,
frequency of information updates, regional council process consistency, implementation
timelines); and

3) Identify opportunities to continue to expand cooperative, constituent-engaged data collection
and research to improve the available ecosystem information in the South Atlantic region (e.g.,
study fleets, cooperative research, citizen science).


# Methods

## Conduct an ecosystem information review across Councils, including SAFMC

Comprehensive literature review: peer reviewed literature and Council webpage search for current and past ecosystem approaches

Lit search terms 

Google search and google scholar: "ecosystem indicators US fishery management councils"

NOAA IR: "ecosystem status report" "climate vulnerability analysis" "fisheries ecosystem plan"

Structured interviews of key regional personnel to document ecosystem information sources, data products, and processes where ecosystem information is used for each U.S. Fishery Management Council, including SAFMC. 

This comprehensive review will place current SAFMC practice and products in the context of the experience of all other U.S. Councils, and set the stage to identify opportunities to use its existing ecosystem information resources, including an ecosystem status report, climate vulnerability analyses for fish and fishing communities, and citizen science program.

## Develop recommendations for ways to incorporate ecosystem information into SAFMC fisheries management processes

Annual catch specification--ESRs/ESPs into assessments, SSC processes for ABC buffers. Can ESPs work in SEDAR and SAFMC SSC processes?

To identify opportunities specific to SAFMC processes beyond catch decisions, I will review both SEDAR processes and Council actions for the past 3-5 years to evaluate current and potential pathways for the use of ecosystem information. This review will include inter-jurisdictional processes such as the East Coast Climate Scenario Planning and subsequent East Coast Climate Coordination Group. Noting that the Council is also currently requesting proposals to review its fisheries management process, I would coordinate with that project if practical given project timelines. Based on this review, I will classify management decisions by data needs and process timelines to develop a prioritized list of processes linked to ecosystem information and recommend practical pathways for implementation. Below are several examples that could be further refined for the South Atlantic context during the project.

# Results

## Ecosystem information review across Councils

ADD TABLES: ESR sections and indicator contents by Council, CVA species by Council, ESP species by Council, FEP structure by Council

PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS/HYPOTHESES TO TEST

Three general categories for current use of ecosystem products: FMP/indicator based, FEP/geographically based, and developing

WPFMC and CFMC: island based FEP/FMPs structure decisions for species within a defined ecoregion, done because each island has distinct social, economic, and ecological conditions and conducting species assessments across all islands was probably never practical. Characterized by a lot of species, many data limited

NPFMC, PFMC, MAFMC, NEFMC: species based FMPs structure decisions although many species can be within an FMP. Annual ecosystem indicator reports are produced and presented to each Council. Ecosystem indicators have been examined and sometimes used at the full ecosystem, ecoregion (subset of area within Council jurisdiction), species, and stock levels for decision making. Characterized by high value data rich stocks with complex quantitative assessments although data limited stocks and species complexes are also in the region

SAFMC, GFMC: developing. species based FMPs structure decisions although many species can be within an FMP. SAFMC has a voluminous FEP and a recent ecosystem indicator report, though not annual.  I need to look at GFMC that is the only one where I have no idea right now.

### In depth each Council, pre interview

#### NPFMC

The North Pacific Region has three Ecosystem Status Reports (ESRs), one for each ecoregion: Eastern Bering Sea [@siddon_ecosystem_2024], Gulf of Alaska [@ferriss_ecosystem_2024], and Aleutian Islands [@ortiz_ecosystem_2024]. Reports include graphical and text report cards for each region, ecosystem assessment sections, and detailed indicator sections, with multiple appendices. In this region, Ecosystem and Socio-economic Profiles (ESPs), an ecosystem status report tailored to an individual stock, were invented [@shotwell_introducing_2023] and are produced for select stocks: Alaska sablefish [@shotwell_ecosystem_2024-2], Eastern Bering Sea Pacific cod [@shotwell_ecosystem_2024-1], Eastern Bering Sea snow crab [@fedewa_appendix_2024], Bristol Bay red king crab [@fedewa_appendix_2024-1], Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands tanner crab [@fedewa_ecosystem_2024], Aleutian Islands Atka mackerel [@], Gulf of Alaska pollock [@shotwell_appendix_2024], Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod[@shotwell_ecosystem_2024], and Gulf of Alaska arrowtooth flounder [@]. A separate annual economic status report is also presented. All are available online https://www.npfmc.org/library/safe-reports/. 

To date ecosystem indicators have been used directly in X stock assessments. 

ESRs are produced annually, and ESPs are updated annually (?), with both presented alongside updated stock assessments in the Council's annual specifications process. Both ESRs and ESPs feed into annual catch specification through risk tables presented in stock assessments [@dorn_risk_2020]. Both data products draw on process research conducted in the region to develop indicators.

NPFMC is still managing using FMPs; this process is used in two, the groundfish and crab FMPs. Not used in other FMPs for scallop and salmon. 

FEPs have been developed for the Aleutian Islands (shelved) and the Bering Sea (active). The Bering Sea FEP intends to use ESRs for monitoring progress against ecosystem objectives, and has "action modules" focusing on climate readiness, incorporation of local and traditional knowledge, evaluating current management alongside EBFM best practice, developing conceptual models, and alignment of Council priorities with research funding. 

The BS FEP team appears to meet annually, the most recent meeting was January 2024. Are other action modules to be activated, or are they at capacity? 

The first two FEP action modules have been initiated, and a final report is available from the Climate Change Task Force, as well as a ranking of climate readiness completed by the Climate Change Task force. Climate readiness was ranked 2-3 out of a possible scale of 5 This report noted the importance of ESRs in providing links between observed trends and long term climate change.

![Fig 2, NPFMC Climate readiness evaluation](images/NPFMC_ClimateReadiness2022.png)

A Climate Vulnerability Analysis for Bering Sea species has been published [@spencer_trait-based_2019], however its direct use in management processes is unclear... The Climate Ready Synthesis recommended inclusion of climate vulnerability information in status reports/risk assessments; perhaps this is being done?

A climate scenario planning workshop took place in June 2024. How has this been integrated?

The Climate Change Task Force recommended several next steps and the Council took action in Dec 2024 to address the steps. The SSC held a [workshop in June 2025](https://meetings.npfmc.org/Meeting/Details/3093) to address a Council October 2024 motion ‘Consider to what extent, and whether, to revise groundfish and crab harvest control rules (HCRs) to be more climate-resilient." This is a step towards bringing alternative harvest management measures with more climate awaremess and flexibility to the Council. 

It appears the NPFMC IRA projects were to address some of these steps and the Council may also be initiating a programmatic EIS to encompass climate-ready/resilient management goals and objectives. This would likely expand beyond ABC/TAC specification to other management measures such as spatial management (noted in the Climate Ready Synthesis). 

ESRs have been produced since 1995, are also presented as contextual information, and have been used to adjust TAC advice in the past [@zador_ecosystem_2016]. AFSC staff produce the reports as part of their regular duties (dedicated resources), while contributors range from NOAA staff to academic researchers in the region who have varying availability or resources to update indicators. The Council's FEP driven Climate Change Task Force identified a need for additional resources to implement recommendations for improving climate readiness.

The North Pacific Council region includes multiple large marine ecosystems, a single U.S. state (Alaska) and federal waters. Stock and ecosystem areas are spatially aligned, and stock and ecosystem assessments are temporally aligned. Commercial fisheries dominate landings.

#### PFMC

The Pacific Council a single ESR produced annually for the California Current ecoregion [@], consisting of a graphical summary and ~40 page main report with many detailed appendices for indicators and methods. Additional appendices are included for both short term and long term ecological and climate forecasts. Forecast uncertainty and evaluation of previous forecasts are included. 

ESPs or ESP like products exist for X species.

The SSC is evaluating risk tables in progress for stock assessments and ABC decisions (see below), but they are reframed as uncertainty tables using IPCC "confidence" language on degree of agreement of indicatots and robustness of evidence). 

CVA exists [@mcclure_vulnerability_2023] and is proposed for use as a component in the process determining ABC uncertainty buffers (see below).

FEP developed (2013 and 2022) and requests annual ESRs. The 2022 FEP is informational an d not prescriptive, retaining Council discretion to act on ecosystem information. It specifies goals and objectievs as well as "ecosystem initiatives" that focus on priority actions (described below). The FEP and includes an outline of ecosystem science uses in the Council process. 

FEP Initiative 1 prohibited directed fishing on currently unexploited, unmanaged forage fish in the region and was completed in 2015. FEP Initiative 2 reviewed the ESR 2015-2016 to better inform the Council of both ecosystem indicators and processes and the potential use of this information in management. FEP Initiative 3, completed in 2019, was the Climate and Communities initiative to evalaute potential impacts of climate change and identify ways to improve flexibility and responsiveness of management. As part of this initiative, climate scenario planning was completed. How is this being used?

FEP Initiative 4, [Ecosystem and Climate Information for Species, Fisheries, and FMPs](https://www.pcouncil.org/actions/ecosystem-and-climate-information-for-species-fisheries-and-fmps/), is currently active and is developing an ecosystem and climate risk assessment framework for use in the catch specification process. This is patterned on the use of risk tables in NPFMC harvest specification, but is tailored to the p* process used in PFMC. The ecosystem team tested options and recommended one where ecosystem and climate risks would alter the sigma applied to characterize scientific uncertainty in the OFL  (sigma is equivalent to the MAFMC SSC OFL CV). PFMC sigmas are 0.5 for high certainty assessments, 1 for data moderate assessments, and 2 for data limited assessments, with additional increases in sigma as time passes since the most recent assessment. Ecosystem and climate risks could further inform sigma, increasing or decreasing it as these factors increase or decrease uncertainty. 

In lieu of an ESP type product, the proposal would be for ecosystem and stock scientists to have a structured conversation to identify key uncertainties in the assessment and evaluate ecosystem drivers of the stock not included in the assessment to fill out a table indicating whether ecosystem conditions are favorable, neutral, or unfavorable for the stock. This draws on previous literature and the indicators reported in the ESR. Information from the CVA for each stock is included in this discussion. The structured discussion template is included in the [2024 report](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2024/08/h-1-a-cciea-team-report-1-cciea-risk-table-report-on-fep-initiative-4.pdf/).

Use in other management processes?

Both the Northwest and Southwest fisheries science centers have dedicated staff supporting ESR production. 

The Pacific Council region includes one large marine ecosystem spanning three states and federal waters. Mostly commercial fisheries?

#### WPFMC

The Western Pacific Council manages with 5 place-based Fishery Ecosystem Plans established in 2010: Hawaii, American Samoa, Mariana, Pacific remote islands, Pelagic. Online organization places fishery and protected species management on the same page for each FEP. The Council guiding principles include promoting an ecosystem approach. The Council has Regional Ecosystem Advisory Committees (REACs) made up of Council members and government officials, business, academic, and NGO representatives who are responsible for or interested in activities on land and outside fisheries that may affect fishery management; REACs represent Hawaii, American Samoa, and Mariana Archipelago.  

An ESR for Hawaii with the same geographic scope as Hawaii FEP was produced in 2022 [@gove_2022_2022]; prior reports were for West Hawaii only. The 2022 report includes socioeconomic, fisheries, coral reef, climate, human impact, and coral reef climate vulnerability sections. Identifies cumulative impacts. Aspects on nearshore fisheries were included at the request of the Council. Habitat recovery depends on both land based and fishery management. Has the Council seen this? Do they use it?  PIFSC is on the Hawaii REAC for the Council. 

CVA was conducted for the full Pacific Islands region [@giddens_assessing_2022]. 

Active spatial ecosystem indicators include [turtle watch](https://oceanwatch.pifsc.noaa.gov/turtlewatch.html) that is updated daily to indicate regions of potential turtle bycatch for pelagic fisheries based on temperature, and [ocean watch](https://oceanwatch.pifsc.noaa.gov/indicators.html) that summarizes ocean conditions in key fishing and coral areas. Ocean watch data includes coral reef bleaching hotspot and alert area data but I can't find how this translates into an indicator being used.  

There is a Fisheries Ecosystem Analysis Tool ([FEAT](https://apps-pifsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/FEAT/#/)) online that summarizes fishery performance indicators 2002-2018 (landings, revenue, and participation by fleet and region), cost data through 2016, nearshore state and island fishery trends, spatial catch and effort in the Western Pacific, and reports on social science work. 

The State of Hawaii is using layers on [cumulative impacts](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=ca750b9476fb429b809d1300628f3bb7), habitat efforts are also using the information. 

The Hawaii EEZ is slightly bigger than the West Coast EEZ. Resources for ecosystem reporting are limited in PIFSC.

#### NEFMC

The New England region gets a State of the Ecosystem (SOE) report each year that covers two ecoregions: the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank [@caracappa_state_2025]. Coastwide Northeast U.S. indicators are also included. Ecosystem profiles and ESPs have been produced for 3 species during research track assessments: American plaice [@behan_ecosystem_2022-1; @behan_environmental_2022], Atlantic cod [@behan_profile_2023; @behan_environmental_2023; @tyrell_development_2023], and Atlantic herring [@molina_atlantic_2025]. All Northeast US ESPs to date are listed here: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/ecosystems/ecosystem-and-socioeconomic-profile-development-and-reports

To date ecosystem indicators have been integrated into X stock assessments

The Council is developing a risk policy that will use some indicators from the SOE and possibly ESPs. 

A climate vulnerability analysis for Northeast U.S. species has been published [@hare_vulnerability_2016], and provides input to the new risk policy currently in development by the Council. Both community climate vulnerability [@colburn_indicators_2016] and habitat climate vulnerability [@farr_assessment_2021] have also been assessed in the Northeast U.S., and marine mammal climate vulnerability has been assessed for the entire Atlantic Coast [@lettrich_vulnerability_2023]. 

The Council previously developed an example Fisheries Ecosystem Plan with ecosystem and aggregate stock level catch limits (ceilings) and stock level minimum biomass thresholds (floors) for 10 species on Georges Bank. The Council has suspended development of this FEP approach in favor of the new indicator-based risk policy.

#### MAFMC

The Mid-Atlantic region gets a State of the Ecosystem (SOE) report each year that covers one ecoregion: the Mid-Atlantic Bight [@gaichas_state_2025]. Coastwide Northeast U.S. indicators are also included. Ecosystem socio-economic profiles have been produced for X stocks during research track assessments:  black sea bass [@tabandera_black_2024], bluefish [@tyrell_bluefish_2022], golden tilefish [@salois_golden_2024], longfin inshore squid (in progress as of October 2025), and shortfin squid [@salois_oceanographic_2022]. All Northeast US ESPs to date are listed here: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/ecosystems/ecosystem-and-socioeconomic-profile-development-and-reports

To date, ecosystem indicators have been integrated into the operational black sea bass assessment and into research track models for black sea bass and bluefish. 

The Council uses indicators from both the SOE and ESPs in an annual ecosystem-level risk assessment. This risk assessment has been used to identify priority fisheries for further analysis with conceptual modeling and managment strategy evaluation. The risk assessment was expaneded in 2024 to include additional risk elements, indicators, and risk criteria.

A climate vulnerability analysis for Northeast U.S. species has been published [@hare_vulnerability_2016], and is considered within the SSC's ABC deliberation process as part of ecosystem factors contributing to uncertainty in the OFL. Both community climate vulnerability [@colburn_indicators_2016] and habitat climate vulnerability [@farr_assessment_2021] have also been assessed in the Northeast U.S., and marine mammal climate vulnerability has been assessed for the entire Atlantic Coast [@lettrich_vulnerability_2023]. A habitat-species climate vulnerability crosswalk is also being considered during deliberations, but is not yet formally part of the OFL CV protocol.
