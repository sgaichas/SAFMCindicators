# Objectives

1) Review the different types of ecosystem data and information including data products and
decision-support tools (e.g. Ecosystem Status Reports, Climate Vulnerability Assessments, risk
assessments) currently available to the regional management councils and evaluate how they are
used in council management processes;

2) Identify opportunities and methods for incorporating identified ecosystem information into
SAFMC management processes, including inter-jurisdictional management decision-making
processes, and identify practical requirements for successful implementation (e.g. data quality,
frequency of information updates, regional council process consistency, implementation
timelines); and

3) Identify opportunities to continue to expand cooperative, constituent-engaged data collection
and research to improve the available ecosystem information in the South Atlantic region (e.g.,
study fleets, cooperative research, citizen science).


# Methods

## Conduct an ecosystem information review across Councils, including SAFMC

Comprehensive literature review: peer reviewed literature and Council webpage search for current and past ecosystem approaches

Lit search terms 

Google search and google scholar: "ecosystem indicators US fishery management councils"

NOAA IR: "ecosystem status report" "climate vulnerability analysis" "fisheries ecosystem plan"

Structured interviews of key regional personnel to document ecosystem information sources, data products, and processes where ecosystem information is used for each U.S. Fishery Management Council, including SAFMC. 

This comprehensive review will place current SAFMC practice and products in the context of the experience of all other U.S. Councils, and set the stage to identify opportunities to use its existing ecosystem information resources, including an ecosystem status report, climate vulnerability analyses for fish and fishing communities, and citizen science program.

## Develop recommendations for ways to incorporate ecosystem information into SAFMC fisheries management processes

Annual catch specification--ESRs/ESPs into assessments, SSC processes for ABC buffers. Can ESPs work in SEDAR and SAFMC SSC processes?

To identify opportunities specific to SAFMC processes beyond catch decisions, I will review both SEDAR processes and Council actions for the past 3-5 years to evaluate current and potential pathways for the use of ecosystem information. This review will include inter-jurisdictional processes such as the East Coast Climate Scenario Planning and subsequent East Coast Climate Coordination Group. Noting that the Council is also currently requesting proposals to review its fisheries management process, I would coordinate with that project if practical given project timelines. Based on this review, I will classify management decisions by data needs and process timelines to develop a prioritized list of processes linked to ecosystem information and recommend practical pathways for implementation. Below are several examples that could be further refined for the South Atlantic context during the project.

# Results

## Ecosystem information review across Councils

PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS/HYPOTHESES TO TEST

Three general categories for current use of ecosystem products: FMP/indicator based, FEP/geographically based, and developing

WPFMC and CFMC: island based FEP/FMPs structure decisions for species within a defined ecoregion, done because each island has distinct social, economic, and ecological conditions and conducting species assessments across all islands was probably never practical. Characterized by a lot of species, many data limited

NPFMC, PFMC, MAFMC, NEFMC: species based FMPs structure decisions although many species can be within an FMP. Annual ecosystem indicator reports are produced and presented to each Council. Ecosystem indicators have been examined and sometimes used at the full ecosystem, ecoregion (subset of area within Council jurisdiction), species, and stock levels for decision making. Characterized by high value data rich stocks with complex quantitative assessments although data limited stocks and species complexes are also in the region

SAFMC, GFMC: developing. species based FMPs structure decisions although many species can be within an FMP. SAFMC has a voluminous FEP and a recent ecosystem indicator report, though not annual.  I need to look at GFMC that is the only one where I have no idea right now.

### In depth each Council, pre interview

##### NPFMC

The North Pacific Region has three Ecosystem Status Reports (ESRs), one for each ecoregion: Eastern Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, and Aleutian Islands. In this region, Ecosystem and Socio-economic Profiles (ESPs), an ecosystem status report tailored to an individual stock, were invented [@shotwell] and are produced for select stocks: Alaska sablefish, Eastern Bering Sea Pacific cod, Eastern Bering Sea snow crab, Bristol Bay red king crab, Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands tanner crab, Gulf of Alaska pollock, and Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod. A separate annual economic status report is also presented. All are available online https://www.npfmc.org/library/safe-reports/. 

ESRs are produced annually, and ESPs are updated annually (?), with both presented alongside updated stock assessments in the Council's annual specifications process. Both ESRs and ESPs feed into annual catch specification through risk tables presented in stock assessments [@dorn]. Both data products draw on process research conducted in the region to develop indicators.

Still working within FMP but this process in two, groundfish and crab.

FEPs have been developed for the Aleutian Islands (shelved) and the Bering Sea (active).

A Climate Vulnerability Analysis for Bering Sea species has been published, however its direct use in management processes is unclear. 

ESRs have been produced since 1995,  are also presented as contextual information, and have been used to adjust TAC advice in the past [@zador]

##### PFMC

ESR and risk tables in progress

CVA exists

FEP developed

##### WPFMC

ESR and CVAs exist

Island based FEPs

##### NEFMC

The New England region gets a State of the Ecosystem (SOE) report each year that covers two ecoregions: the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank. Coastwide Northeast U.S. indicators are also included. Ecosystem profiles and ESPs have been produced for X stocks during research track assessments: Atlantic herring, 

The Council is developing a risk policy that will use some indicators from the SOE and possibly ESPs. 

A climate vulnerability analysis for Northeast U.S. species has been published, and provides input to the new risk policy currently in development by the Council. 

The Council previously developed an example Fisheries Ecosystem Plan with ecosystem and aggregate stock level catch limits (ceilings) and stock level minimum biomass thresholds (floors) for 10 species on Georges Bank. The Council has suspended development of this FEP approach in favor of the new indicator-based risk policy. 

##### MAFMC

The Mid-Atlantic region gets a State of the Ecosystem (SOE) report each year that covers one ecoregion: the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Coastwide Northeast U.S. indicators are also included. Ecosystem socio-economic profiles have been produced for X stocks during research track assessments: bluefish, black sea bass, golden tilefish, 

The Council uses indicators from both the SOE and ESPs in an annual ecosystem-level risk assessment. This risk assessment has been used to identify priority fisheries for further analysis with conceptual modeling and managment strategy evaluation. The risk assessment was expaneded in 2024 to include additional risk elements, indicators, and risk criteria.

A climate vulnerability analysis for Northeast U.S. species has been published, and is considered within the SSC's ABC deliberation process as part of ecosystem factors contributing to uncertainty in the OFL. 

##### CFMC

Newest ESR, never had one before. No CVA?

Island based FMPs

EBFM approach is based on stakeholder derived conceptual models for each Island

##### GFMC

ESR and CVA exists


##### SAFMC

ESR, FEP, and CVA all exist




## Recommendations for SAFMC

SAFMC shares a mix of reef-type or rockfish complex like data limited species with some high value data rich stocks, so a mix of approaches from the above may be warranted.
