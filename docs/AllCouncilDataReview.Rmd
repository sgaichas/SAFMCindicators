# Executive Summary



# Introduction

## Project Overiew



## Objectives

This report addresses the first Project objective:

1) Review the different types of ecosystem data and information including data products and
decision-support tools (e.g. Ecosystem Status Reports, Climate Vulnerability Assessments, risk
assessments) currently available to the regional management councils and evaluate how they are
used in council management processes.

Results reported here will be integrated with forthcoming findings for the next two project objectives addressing opportunities specific to the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council for integrating ecosystem information into its management processes and expanding Citizen Science programs to improve availability of high priority ecosystem information in the region.  

## Review Scope

Ecosystem information for the purposes of this report includes information spanning the physical, biological, and human environment. This follows the definition of Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM) in NOAA Ecosystem policy [@harvey_us_2025]: 

> a systematic approach to fisheries management in a geographically specified area that contributes to the resilience and sustainability of the ecosystem; recognizes the physical, biological, economic, and social interactions among the affected fishery-related components of the ecosystem, including humans; and seeks to optimize benefits among a diverse set of societal goals.

This report considers ecosystem information available and processes used in all 8 regional U.S. Fishery Management Councils: North Pacific (NPFMC), Pacific (PFMC), Western Pacific (WPFMC), New England (NEFMC), Mid-Atlantic (MAFMC), Caribbean (CFMC), Gulf (GFMC), and South Atlantic (SAFMC). In addition, relevant examples from other U.S. organizations, such as the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) and NOAA National Marine Sanctuaries are included. Recognizing that these organizations do not operate under the same legislative mandates as Councils, these examples are intended to illustrate uses of ecosystem information that may still be applicable in a Council context. 

## Definitions and abbreviations

Ecosystem Status Report (ESR): a document summarizing ecosystem information for a particular region, spanning physical, biological, economic, and social information. Indicators are presented and interpreted in the context of historical trends and current status relative to any known reference points. Also known as State of the Ecosystem (SOE) or Ecosystem Considerations reports [@morrison_investigating_2022; @harvey_us_2025]. 

Climate Vulnerability Analysis (CVA): an evaluation of vulnerability to projected climate conditions based on standard metrics of sensitivity and exposure appropriate to the species, habitat, or community being assessed [@bruno_soares_conceptual_2012; @morrison_methodology_2015]. CVA has been applied to marine fish and invertebrates, marine fish and invertebrate habitats, marine mammals, and fishing communities. 

Fishery Management Plan (FMP): a legally required document outlining methods (management measures, regulations, monitoring, research) to achieve fishery management objectives as specified in the U.S. Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Councils determine which fisheries are included in an FMP, describe targeted species and fishing methods, identify essential habitat, and design methods to ensure sustainable optimum yield (maximum benefit to the Nation in terms of seafood production and recreational opportunities while accounting for the protection of marine ecosystems) while meeting other objectives such as bycatch reduction and other legal mandates for protected species. 

Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP): a document outlining methods for ecosystem-based fishery management by providing an ecosystem description, overarching ecosystem policies and goals, and methods for coordinating across managed fisheries and addressing ecosystem interactions. When FEPs contain all components of an FMP, they can be used as FMPs. FEPs were originally outlined and recommended in a 1999 report to Congress, and operational methods for refining and using FEPs have been advanced more recently [@marshall_ecosystem-based_2018; @levin_building_2018].  


# Methods

## Comprehensive literature review

Literature included both peer reviewed scientific literature and Council and other organizational documents that may not appear in peer reviewed literature. Literature search was conducted using Google search and Google scholar, direct search of the NOAA Institutional Repository (IR), and a semi-automated Council webpage search for current and past ecosystem approaches. 

Lit search terms:

*  Google search and google scholar: "ecosystem indicators US fishery management councils"  
*  NOAA IR: "ecosystem status report" "climate vulnerability analysis" "fisheries ecosystem plan"  

Web scraping Council sites for documents including the terms "ecosystem approach|ecosystem indicator|ecosystem report|ecosystem status|ecosystem based" using [this code](https://github.com/sgaichas/SAFMCindicators/blob/main/R/FindCouncilEcoDocs.R)

Documents and information from the Council Coordinating Committee's recent meetings: 

*  2022 Council Member Ongoing Development Workshop on New Approaches to EBFM/EAFM https://www.fisherycouncils.org/cmod-workshops/2022. 
*  2022 Seventh National Scientific Coordination Subcommittee Workshop on Adapting Fisheries Managment to a Changing Ecosystem https://www.fisherycouncils.org/ssc-workshops/scs-7  
*  2024 Eighth National Scientific Coordination Subcommittee Workshop on Applying ABC Control Rules in a Changing Environment https://www.fisherycouncils.org/ssc-workshops/scs-8 

Relevant Council documents were downloaded as pdfs and have been uploaded to SAFMC shared folders for ESRs, ESPs, FEPs, CVAs, and other Council Documents. All cited papers and Council documents were read and reviewed to generate the information in this report. Artifical Intelligence capabilities were used to automate standardized ESR and FEP report summaries across documents as noted below. 

## Gather contextual data about the Councils

How much area do they manage? Summarized in Table 2 from @bachman_use_2025

How many U.S. states and territories are represented in each? Drawn from https://www.fisherycouncils.org/ and each Council's website and documents.

How many FMPs and FEPs? Drawn from https://www.fisherycouncils.org/ and individual Council reviews below.

Current commercial and recreational landings for 2022-2024 were drawn from Fisheries Economics of the US 2022 [@national_marine_fisheries_service_fisheries_2024] and its associated [web data tool](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss/f?p=215:200::::::). The most recent year of commercial and recreational landings data available across all regions was 2023, but the most recent recreational value information was from 2022. We report these as proportions of the total for the U.S. because the absolute numbers vary from year to year but rough proportions have been stable recently. 

## Summarize and compare data products

Draft ESR document summaries and R code to organize document section and indicator names into datasets were initially generated by Claude Sonnet 4.5 from each pdf file, then thoroughly reviewed and hand corrected where they inaccurately represented ESR content. Summaries were repeated using identical prompts on the same document for two ESRs from different regions to determine whether summaries were consistent. Differences between the replicate summaries were limited to formatting; section headings and indicators identified were consistent across replicates. Code to produce the summary datasets [`summtab.csv`](https://github.com/sgaichas/SAFMCindicators/blob/main/summtab.csv) and [`compesrdat.csv`](https://github.com/sgaichas/SAFMCindicators/blob/main/compesrdat.csv) that are used to produce these tables is contained in the document [`ESRsumms.Rmd`](https://github.com/sgaichas/SAFMCindicators/blob/main/docs/ESRsumms.Rmd). 

Note that while indicator counts given here should provide insight for comparisons across regional documents, they are approximate counts. There is interpretation required to count indicators: for example, are abundance and biomass from the same data source two indicators or one? Are time series for different species from the same source presented in one figure one single or multiple indicators? Are monthly vs. annual, local vs. regional sea surface temperature (SST) from the same source different indicators? When reviewing indicator summaries for each report, clearly different indicators were separated to the similar levels reported across all reports.

Council FEP pdf documents were summarized using the Claude API and [this code](https://github.com/sgaichas/SAFMCindicators/blob/main/R/pdfsumm.R). Summaries included an overview combined with a list of stated ecosystem policies, goals, and objectives in the document along. Summaries were compared with the full documents to ensure consistency, and any newer policy documents not included in the FEPs were reviewed individually.

## Structured interviews with Council staff and other knowledgable parties

The primary objective of structured interviews was to determine what the Council's think about their ecosystem information products and processes.

Council staff from each region were selected for interviews based on their role. Ecosystem, habitat, and/or climate leads were included if Councils identified staff in such roles, along with . Executive directors and or Deputies were also invited for interviews. 

Interviews were coordinated with the team leading the Fishery Management Process Review using logistics software developed by that team. Potential interviewees were contacted with an email briefly describing the project goals and an invitation to be interviewed. Those accepting the invitation filled out a google form confirming agreement to be interviewed and gathering basic contact information, years of experience, and initial thoughts on the interview questions listed below, then scheduled an interview at the time of their choice using the software that included the interviewer's schedule. 

Interviews could be 30-90 minutes depending on the interviewee's selected time slot. All interviews were conducted by Sarah Gaichas.

Interview Template:

*  Review Data products from lit review  
*  Review Uses of record from lit review  
*  Validate the above, then:  
*  What other uses not recorded?  
*  What are successes with current information and processes  
*  What are and challenges with current information and processes  
*  What might be done differently to better meet each Council’s objectives  

Interviews were scheduled during November and December of 2025.

# Results

## Council Context and Overview

The Regional U.S. Fishery Management Councils are highly diverse in the amount of area managed, the number of states and territories involved, the number of FMPs and FEPs in place, and commercial and recreational landings and value.

All of the Councils have at least one ESR or similar ecosystem data product. However, not all reports are updated annually.

This table gives an overview of which Councils receive which reports, the reporting region, the most recent year of the report, report length, number of sections, approximate number of indicators (see note above), and the first and last section headers in each report. This give some insight into structural differences between the reports. Additional tables listing sections and numbers of indicators for each report, and listing indicator names for each report, are available [online here](https://sgaichas.github.io/SAFMCindicators/ESRcomparisons.html).

Most Council regions, aside from the Caribbean, have a completed Climate Vulnerability Analysis (CVA) for fish in the region. Some Council regions have fishing community CVAs, habitat CVAs, and marine mammal CVAs. 

```{r CVAs}

```

Council FEPs (and some FMPs) contain some similar content in terms of ecosystem policies and goals, with regionally specific goals for habitats unique to a given region such as coral reefs. However, Councils have different mechanisms across FEPs or FMPs to operationalize the use of ecosystem information. In each section below, the Council context, management structure, and use of ecosystem data products is detailed for each region based on the literature review. [*Information from interviews will be added to each section once interviews are complete.*]

## Review of Products and Processes by Council *(pre-interview)*

*This section will be expanded once interview are complete. Questions to be clarified during interviews are included in italics.* 

### NPFMC

The North Pacific Council manages fisheries using Fishery Management Plans (FMPs): five FMPs are species-based (Groundfish-2 areas, Crab, Salmon, and Scallop) and one is area-based (Arctic). FMP based single species groundfish and crab management has evolved to include ecosystem indicators in the catch specification process, as described below. 

The North Pacific Region has three Ecosystem Status Reports (ESRs), one for each ecoregion: Eastern Bering Sea [@siddon_ecosystem_2024], Gulf of Alaska [@ferriss_ecosystem_2024], and Aleutian Islands [@ortiz_ecosystem_2024]. Reports include graphical and text report cards for each region, ecosystem assessment sections, and detailed indicator sections, with multiple appendices. In this region, Ecosystem and Socio-economic Profiles (ESPs), an ecosystem status report tailored to an individual stock, were invented [@shotwell_introducing_2023] and are produced for select stocks: Alaska sablefish [@shotwell_ecosystem_2024-2], Eastern Bering Sea Pacific cod [@shotwell_ecosystem_2024-1], Eastern Bering Sea snow crab [@fedewa_appendix_2024], Bristol Bay red king crab [@fedewa_appendix_2024-1], Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands tanner crab [@fedewa_ecosystem_2024], Aleutian Islands Atka mackerel [@sullivan_proposed_2025], Gulf of Alaska pollock [@shotwell_appendix_2024], Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod [@shotwell_ecosystem_2024], and Gulf of Alaska arrowtooth flounder [@shotwell_appendix_2025]. In addition to these ecosystem and stock specific indicator reports, the Council recieves reports on unmanaged forage fish [@vollenweider_2024_2024], grenadiers [@siwicke_assessment_2024], and a multispecies model incorporating climate drivers for Eastern Bering Sea pollock, cod, and arrowtooth flounder [@holsman_2024_2024]. A separate annual economic status report [@abelman_stock_2024] is also presented. All are available online https://www.npfmc.org/library/safe-reports/. 

ESRs are produced annually, and many ESPs are updated annually, with both presented alongside updated stock assessments in the Council's annual specifications process. Both ESRs and ESPs feed into annual catch specification through risk tables presented in stock assessments [@dorn_risk_2020]. Both data products draw on process research conducted in the region to develop indicators. 

To date, risk tables incorporating ecosystem indicators have been presented in up to 18 stock assessments annually. Since risk tables were introduced in 2018, 14 stocks have had reductions in ABC from the maximum permissible due to risk information (including stock assessment, population dynamics, and fishery concerns as well as ecosystem concerns). In 2024, reductions to three stock ABCs were based on stock assessment, population dynamics, and fishery considerations. No reductions were taken in response to ecosystem considerations.

![Figure 1 alt. North Pacific ecosystem data in management processes, reprinted from Siddon, E. 2025 Fig. 1](images/Honeycomb Graphic.png) 
 
FEPs have been developed for the Aleutian Islands (shelved) and the Bering Sea (active). The Bering Sea FEP intends to use ESRs for monitoring progress against ecosystem objectives, and has "action modules" focusing on climate readiness, incorporation of local and traditional knowledge, evaluating current management alongside EBFM best practice, developing conceptual models, and alignment of Council priorities with research funding. 

The BS FEP team appears to meet annually, the most recent meeting was January 2024. *Are other FEP action modules to be activated, or are they at capacity?* 

The first two FEP action modules have been initiated, and a final report is available from the Climate Change Task Force, as well as a ranking of climate readiness completed by the Climate Change Task force. Climate readiness was ranked 2-3 out of a possible scale of 5 This report noted the importance of ESRs in providing links between observed trends and long term climate change.

![Fig 2, NPFMC Climate readiness evaluation](images/NPFMC_ClimateReadiness2022.png)

A Climate Vulnerability Analysis for Bering Sea species has been published [@spencer_trait-based_2019], however its direct use in management processes is unclear. The Climate Ready Synthesis recommended inclusion of climate vulnerability information in status reports/risk assessments. *Is this being done?*

A climate scenario planning workshop took place in June 2024. *How has this been integrated?*

The Climate Change Task Force recommended several next steps and the Council took action in Dec 2024 to address the steps. The SSC held a [workshop in June 2025](https://meetings.npfmc.org/Meeting/Details/3093) to address a Council October 2024 motion "Consider to what extent, and whether, to revise groundfish and crab harvest control rules (HCRs) to be more climate-resilient." This is a step towards bringing alternative harvest management measures with more climate awareness and flexibility to the Council. 

The NPFMC IRA projects were to address some of these steps and the Council may also be initiating a programmatic EIS to encompass climate-ready/resilient management goals and objectives. This would likely expand beyond ABC/TAC specification to other management measures such as spatial management (noted in the Climate Ready Synthesis). 

ESRs have been produced since 1995, are also presented as contextual information, and have been used to adjust TAC advice in the past [@zador_ecosystem_2016]. AFSC staff produce the reports as part of their regular duties (dedicated resources), while contributors range from NOAA staff to academic researchers in the region who have varying availability or resources to update indicators. The Council's FEP driven Climate Change Task Force identified a need for additional resources to implement recommendations for improving climate readiness.

The North Pacific Council region includes multiple large marine ecosystems, a single U.S. state (Alaska) and federal waters. Stock and ecosystem areas are spatially aligned, and stock and ecosystem assessments are temporally aligned for the groundfish and crab FMPs. Commercial fisheries dominate landings.


### PFMC

The Pacific Council manages under 4 multispecies FMPs: Salmon, Groundfish, Coastal pelagic species, Highly migratory species. 

The Pacific Council FEP was developed in 2013 and revised in 2022. The 2022 FEP is informational and not prescriptive, retaining Council discretion to act on ecosystem information. It specifies goals and objectives as well as "ecosystem initiatives" that focus on priority actions (described below). The FEP includes an outline of ecosystem science uses in the Council process. 

FEP Initiative 1 prohibited directed fishing on currently unexploited, unmanaged forage fish in the region and was completed in 2015. FEP Initiative 2 reviewed the ESR 2015-2016 to better inform the Council of both ecosystem indicators and processes and the potential use of this information in management [@tommasi_case_2021]. FEP Initiative 3, completed in 2019, was the Climate and Communities initiative to evaluate potential impacts of climate change and identify ways to improve flexibility and responsiveness of management. As part of this initiative, climate scenario planning was completed. *How is this being used?*

As prescribed in its FMP, The Pacific Council receives a single ESR produced annually for the California Current ecoregion [@leising_2024-2025_2025-1], consisting of a graphical summary and ~40 page main report with many detailed appendices for indicators and methods. Additional appendices are included for both short term and long term ecological and climate forecasts. Forecast uncertainty and evaluation of previous forecasts are included. 

ESP like products [@tolimieri_oceanographic_2018; @haltuch_oceanographic_2020] exist for at least 2 species.  *Which assessments include ecosystem indicators directly?*

A fish CVA exists [@mcclure_vulnerability_2023] and is proposed for use as a component in the process determining ABC uncertainty buffers (see below).

The SSC is evaluating risk tables in progress for stock assessments and ABC decisions (see below), but they are reframed as uncertainty tables using IPCC "confidence" language on degree of agreement of indicators and robustness of evidence). FEP Initiative 4, [Ecosystem and Climate Information for Species, Fisheries, and FMPs](https://www.pcouncil.org/actions/ecosystem-and-climate-information-for-species-fisheries-and-fmps/), is currently active and is developing an ecosystem and climate risk assessment framework for use in the catch specification process. This is patterned on the use of risk tables in NPFMC harvest specification, but is tailored to the p* process used in PFMC. The ecosystem team tested options and recommended one where ecosystem and climate risks would alter the sigma applied to characterize scientific uncertainty in the OFL  (sigma is equivalent to the MAFMC SSC OFL CV). PFMC sigmas are 0.5 for high certainty assessments, 1 for data moderate assessments, and 2 for data limited assessments, with additional increases in sigma as time passes since the most recent assessment. Ecosystem and climate risks could further inform sigma, increasing or decreasing it as these factors increase or decrease uncertainty. 

In lieu of an ESP type product, the proposal would be for ecosystem and stock scientists to have a structured conversation to identify key uncertainties in the assessment and evaluate ecosystem drivers of the stock not included in the assessment to fill out a table indicating whether ecosystem conditions are favorable, neutral, or unfavorable for the stock. This draws on previous literature and the indicators reported in the ESR. Information from the CVA for each stock is included in this discussion. The structured discussion template is included in the [2024 report](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2024/08/h-1-a-cciea-team-report-1-cciea-risk-table-report-on-fep-initiative-4.pdf/).

*Use in other management processes?*

Both the Northwest and Southwest fisheries science centers have dedicated staff supporting ESR production. The CCIEA team developed the recommendation for use of assessment and ecosystem information in the SSC's ABC decision process. 

The Pacific Council region includes one large marine ecosystem spanning three states and federal waters. Mostly commercial fisheries?


### WPFMC

The Western Pacific Council manages with 5 place-based Fishery Ecosystem Plans established in 2010: Hawaii, American Samoa, Mariana, Pacific remote islands, Pelagic. The Council established the first US ecosystem based FMP for coral reefs in 2004, and initiated development of its FEPs in 2005 with a series of workshops introducing and developing EAFM, focusing on biophysical, social science, and policy aspects of EAFM [@martell_fishery_2020]. Fishery and protected species management issues as well as ecosystem information are considered in each FEP. The Council guiding principles include promoting an ecosystem approach. The Council has Regional Ecosystem Advisory Committees (REACs) made up of Council members and government officials, business, academic, and NGO representatives who are responsible for or interested in activities on land and outside fisheries that may affect fishery management; REACs represent Hawaii, American Samoa, and the Mariana Archipelago.  

Western Pacific SAFE reports for each FEP include three sections: fishery performance, ecosystem considerations, and data integration, and are available at https://www.wpcouncil.org/annual-reports/. Fishery performance includes catch and effort information. The ecosystem considerations include fisher observations, coral reef fish biomass and habitat condition indicators, life history parameters, socioeconomics, protected species, climate and ocean indicators, EFH, and marine planning sections (updated through 2024). The data integration section is intended to link environmental indicators with managed stocks. These sections are less developed in each SAFE. The Hawaii example is uku, but it appears it has not been updated since 2018 and includes data through 2012 [@wprfmc_annual_2025]. There is an ESP for Hawaii uku [@ayers_ecosystem_2022]; *is this being used in the assessment or management or integrated into the SAFE?* The American Samoa [@wprfmc_annual_2025-1] and Marianas Archipelago data integration sections includes multivariate analysis updated through 2016 [@wprfmc_annual_2025-2]. Pelagic [@wprfmc_annual_2025-3] and Pacific Remote Island Area [@wprfmc_annual_2025-4] all include updated climate and ocean indicators. June 2025 Council discussions suggested that summaries of what has changed in SAFEs would be useful for the Council; "dashboard" presentations are being considered by the FEP teams. 

There is a p* process and a Social, Ecological, Economic, and Management (SEEM) process for specifying scientific and management uncertainty, respectively. The p* is done by the SSC while the SEEM process is a collaboration between fishers, scientists, and managers. Research priorities for the coming years seek to bound harvest levels based on stock and ecosystem productivity while considering climate change effects on productivity. 

An ESR for Hawaii with the same geographic scope as Hawaii FEP was produced in 2022 [@gove_2022_2022]; prior reports were for West Hawaii only. The 2022 report includes socioeconomic, fisheries, coral reef, climate, human impact, and coral reef climate vulnerability sections, and identifies cumulative impacts. Aspects on nearshore fisheries were included at the request of the Council. Habitat recovery depends on both land based and fishery management. PIFSC is on the Hawaii REAC for the Council. *Has the ecosystem considerations portion of each SAFE replaced this? How related are they?* 

CVA was conducted for the full Pacific Islands region [@giddens_assessing_2022]. *Are there plans to included/reference CVA in FEP SAFE reports?*

Active spatial ecosystem indicators include [turtle watch](https://oceanwatch.pifsc.noaa.gov/turtlewatch.html) that is updated daily to indicate regions of potential turtle bycatch for pelagic fisheries based on temperature, and [ocean watch](https://oceanwatch.pifsc.noaa.gov/indicators.html) that summarizes ocean conditions in key fishing and coral areas. Ocean watch data includes coral reef bleaching hotspot and alert area data. *Does this translate into an indicator being used?*  

There is a Fisheries Ecosystem Analysis Tool ([FEAT](https://apps-pifsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/FEAT/#/)) online that summarizes fishery performance indicators 2002-2018 (landings, revenue, and participation by fleet and region), cost data through 2016, nearshore state and island fishery trends, spatial catch and effort in the Western Pacific, and reports on social science work. 

The State of Hawaii is using layers on [cumulative impacts](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=ca750b9476fb429b809d1300628f3bb7), habitat efforts are also using the information. 

The Hawaii EEZ is slightly bigger than the West Coast EEZ, and the full Western Pacific region represents nearly half of the total U.S. EEZ. Resources for ecosystem reporting are limited in PIFSC, but many scientists are listed as contributors to SAFEs. *How are resources allocated to ecosystem work?*


### NEFMC

The New England Council manages under 9 FMPs. Three are mutispecies FMPs: Northeast multispecies ("groundfish"), Small mesh multispecies, and Skates; and six are single species FMPs: Atlantic Scallop, Atlantic Herring, Monkfish, Dogfish, Salmon, Deep Sea Red Crab. Dogfish and Monkfish FMPs are joint with the Mid-Atlantic Council. The Atlantic Herring FMP features a harvest control rule that was designed to account for herring's role as forage in the ecosystem using a multi-species stakeholder-driven management strategy evaluation [@deroba_dream_2018; @feeney_integrating_2019]. 

An [example FEP](https://d23h0vhsm26o6d.cloudfront.net/3_Draft-example-Fishery-Ecosystem-Plan-eFEP_190830_113712.pdf) was developed between 2012 and 2024 illustrating ecosystem based management on Georges Bank, including management with aggregate ecosystem and fish guild level total allowable catches (ceilings) and single species minimum biomass thresholds (floors) for 10 species on Georges Bank. The proposed EBFM was designed to address both ecological and fleet technical interactions and the need for increased fishery operational flexibility. However, this FEP was not formally adopted, and the Council has suspended development of this FEP approach in favor of the new indicator-based risk policy operating within established FMPs (described below).

The New England region gets a State of the Ecosystem (SOE) report each year that covers two ecoregions: the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank [@caracappa_state_2025]. Coastwide Northeast U.S. indicators are also included. The New England SOE report includes a graphical summary section and three report sections: performance against fishery management objectives, risks to meeting fishery management objectives, and ecosystem highlights from the most recent year. Fishery management objectives are drawn from U.S. legislation [@depiper_operationalizing_2017], and risks include climate-driven changes and other ocean uses (offshore wind development). 

Ecosystem profiles and ESPs have been produced for 3 species during research track assessments: American plaice [@behan_ecosystem_2022-1; @behan_environmental_2022], Atlantic cod [@behan_profile_2023; @behan_environmental_2023; @tyrell_development_2023], and Atlantic herring [@molina_atlantic_2025]. All Northeast US ESPs to date are listed here: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/ecosystems/ecosystem-and-socioeconomic-profile-development-and-reports

To date ecosystem indicators have been integrated into 2 research track stock assessments for Southern New England Mid Atlantic (Gulf Stream Index controls expected recruitment) and Georges Bank (deviation from BH recruitment controlled by bottom temperature) yellowtail flounder. Decisions were based on literature review and statistical indicator testing similar to an ESP process. 

The Council is developing a [risk policy](https://d23h0vhsm26o6d.cloudfront.net/Risk-Policy-Statement-and-Concept-Overview-for-posting-v1-final.pdf) that will use some indicators from the SOE and possibly ESPs. The policy evaluates risk due to stock status and assessment uncertainty, climate and ecosystem drivers, and economic and community considerations. Indicators are being selected for each category will be scored according to criteria established for the category, then scores across categories are to be weighted by the Council to achieve an overall risk score for each stock given the set of indicators. The risk score would then be used to adjust the buffer between OFL and ABC using the established control rule for the stock in question (NEFMC harvest control rules vary by FMP). The Council plans to start with its groundfish FMP to refine this indicator based risk approach.

![Figure 3, NEFMC Risk Policy indicator scoring](images/NEFMC_RiskPolicy2025.png) 

A climate vulnerability analysis for Northeast U.S. species has been published [@hare_vulnerability_2016], and provides input to the new risk policy currently in development by the Council. Both community climate vulnerability [@colburn_indicators_2016] and habitat climate vulnerability [@farr_assessment_2021] have also been assessed in the Northeast U.S., and marine mammal climate vulnerability has been assessed for the entire Atlantic Coast [@lettrich_vulnerability_2023]. 

Northeast SOE reports have been produced annually since 2017. Prior to that, longer ESRs were produced in 2002, 2009, 2012, and 2015. The NEFSC dedicates staff time to developing annual ecosystem reports and intermittent ESPs. 

The New England Council region includes five states with a long history of commercial fishing, including heavy historical exploitation by foreign fleets. New England fisheries are dominated by commercial fisheries, including highly economically valuable Atlantic scallop fishery, and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission-managed lobster fishery. 


### MAFMC

The Mid-Atlantic Council manages under 7 FMPs; 4 multispecies (Summer flounder scup and black sea bass; Mackerel squid and butterfish, Surfclam and ocean quahog, and Tilefish) and 3 single species (Bluefish, Spiny Dogfish, Monkfish). Dogfish and Monkfish FMPs are joint with the New England Council.

The Council's Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) Policy Guidance Document functions similarly to an FEP in outlining Council policy in a non-regulatory document. It highlights EAFM policy guidance in several strategic areas including forage fish, habitat, climate change, and ecosystem interactions, with social and economic issues considered through all strategic areas. Based on the EAFM policy strategic areas, the Council has implemented operational management including an unmanaged forage amendment, updated EFH designations based on a regional habitat assessment, and climate change research, scenario planning, and multi-Council coordination. 

The policy guidance for addressing ecosystem interactions outlines a decision process beginning with risk assessment for prioritizing key interactions, conceptual modeling for identifying links between risks, information gaps, and questions the Council can address, and management strategy evaluation to quantitatively analyze tradeoffs and management options regarding the high priority ecosystem interactions [@gaichas_framework_2016]. The EAFM risk assessment has been used to identify priority fisheries for further analysis with conceptual modeling [@depiper_learning_2021] and management strategy evaluation [@muffley_there_2021]. The risk assessment was expanded in 2024 to include additional risk elements, indicators, and risk criteria.

The Mid-Atlantic region gets a State of the Ecosystem (SOE) report each year that covers one ecoregion: the Mid-Atlantic Bight [@gaichas_state_2025]. Coastwide Northeast U.S. indicators are also included. The Mid-Atlantic SOE report includes a graphical summary section and three report sections: performance against fishery management objectives, risks to meeting fishery management objectives, and ecosystem highlights from the most recent year. Fishery management objectives are drawn from U.S. legislation [@depiper_operationalizing_2017], and risks include climate-driven changes and other ocean uses (offshore wind development). 

Ecosystem socio-economic profiles have been produced for 5 stocks during research track assessments:  black sea bass [@tabandera_black_2024], bluefish [@tyrell_bluefish_2022], golden tilefish [@salois_golden_2024], longfin inshore squid (in progress as of October 2025), and shortfin squid [@salois_oceanographic_2022]. All Northeast US ESPs to date are listed here: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/ecosystems/ecosystem-and-socioeconomic-profile-development-and-reports

The Council develops annual Fishery Performance Reports using its FMP Advisory Panels that include market, social, economic, and ecosystem influences on fishery productivity from the perspectives of fishery participants. These reports accompany operational stock assessments and fishery data updates through the Council process from the SSC decisions on ABC through committees and Council decisions on ACLs. 

To date, ecosystem indicators have been integrated into the operational black sea bass assessment (winter bottom temperature, northern area influences expected recruitment) and into research track models for black sea bass and bluefish (forage fish index influences recreational index catchability). Decisions were based on ESPs.

The Council uses indicators from both the SOE and ESPs in an annual ecosystem-level risk assessment [@gaichas_implementing_2018]. This risk assessment is part of the Council's Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) as laid out in their 2019 policy document. 

![Figure 4, MAFMC Indicator-based EAFM Risk Assessment](images/MAFMCrisk2025.png)

A climate vulnerability analysis for Northeast U.S. species has been published [@hare_vulnerability_2016], and is considered within the SSC's ABC deliberation process as part of ecosystem factors contributing to uncertainty in the OFL. Both community climate vulnerability [@colburn_indicators_2016] and habitat climate vulnerability [@farr_assessment_2021] have also been assessed in the Northeast U.S., and marine mammal climate vulnerability has been assessed for the entire Atlantic Coast [@lettrich_vulnerability_2023]. A habitat-species climate vulnerability [crosswalk](https://nrha.shinyapps.io/dataexplorer/#!/crosswalk) summarizing species vulnerability and life history stages dependent on climate vulnerable habitat is also being considered during SSC deliberations, but is not yet formally part of the OFL CV protocol. 

Northeast SOE reports have been produced annually since 2017. Prior to that, longer ESRs were produced in 2002, 2009, 2012, and 2015. The NEFSC dedicates staff time to developing annual ecosystem reports and intermittent ESPs. 

Mid-Atlantic managed fisheries are approximately evenly split between commercial and recreational. A large proportion of commercial landings in the Mid-Atlantic region are Atlantic menhaden, which is managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.


### CFMC

The Caribbean Council manages under three Island-Based FMPs for for Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and St. Thomas/St. John. The FMPs identify objectives and measures for all of the major fisheries, habitat, and ecosystem issues in each region. Up until 2022, the Caribbean Council managed under region-wide FMPs for spiny lobster, queen conch, reef fish, and corals (with a prohibition on coral take). The Island-Based FMPs were initiated in 2012 to address management issues unique to each island and to lay the groundwork for place-based EBFM; these Island-Based FMPs have been used for management since October 2022. The Island Based FMPs all refer to EBFM as the overarching management principle, and include goals and objectives related both to fishery stock management and sustainable ecosystem services.

An FEP is under development by the Council's EBFM Technical Advisory Panel (TAP) using ecosystem conceptual models developed for each island by District Advisory Panels and diverse stakeholder groups [@seara_development_2024] as a starting point to identify "where we are now" in the FEP loop [@levin_building_2018]. The conceptual models identify the most important ecological and social components, relationships, and drivers of each island fishery ecosystem, as informed by expert knowledge from fishers, managers, and scientists serving on the SSC. 

![Figure 5. Ecosystem relationships common across stakeolder conceptual models, from Seara et al 2024](images/CaribConsensusModel.png)

The Caribbean region has the newest ESR [@southeast_integrated_ecosystem_assessment_program_caribbean_2025], the first produced for this region. The Caribbean ESR is organized according to the goals and objectives identified in each Island Based FMP, and uses indicators inspired by the conceptual models developed for each island. The first section of the report evaluates progress towards FMP objectives in the categories of food production, socioeconomic health, equity, engagement/participation, bycatch reduction, governance, and ecosystem protection. The second section evaluates risks to meeting those objectives. 

A project is in progress to develop fishery species CVA for this region (see below). Marine mammal climate vulnerability has been assessed for the entire Atlantic Coast including the Caribbean [@lettrich_vulnerability_2023]. 

Current Council projects include "Developing a US Caribbean Hub to Operationalize EBFM in the US Caribbean" to advance indicator-based risk assessment, "Evaluating Priority Species Vulnerability to Changing Environmental Conditions" to initiate a CVA for the region, and "Understanding Impacts of Extreme Events on the Fishery Ecosystem and the Fishers’ Communities in the U.S. Caribbean" to strengthen outreach and education. 

The Caribbean Council is one of three regional Councils served by SEFSC, the other two are the Gulf and South Atlantic. While SEFSC dedicates some staff resources to ecosystem reporting, resources to date have been inadequate to produce annual ecosystem reports across all three regions. However, streamlined processes and automation were developed for the current ESR that may permit more frequent updates. 

Caribbean fisheries are characterized by high species diversity, critical dependence on vulnerable nearshore and coral reef habitats, many artisanal commercial fishers with a variety of gears landing in many ports, and a recreational fishery with similar characteristics and yield; these conditions make typical single species data collection, assessment, and management approaches difficult [@appeldoorn_transforming_2008]. 


### GFMC

The Gulf Council manages under 7 FMPs; 4 multispecies (Coastal migratory pelagics, Reef fish, Shrimp, Coral) and 3 single species (Red drum, Spiny lobster, Stone crab), with and additional FMP for Aquaculture.  The original Coral FMP was joint with South Atlantic Council. 

A draft Gulf FEP was completed in 2022. This FEP also evaluated cooperative research and citizen science programs. Further FEP development is in progress with the Council's ecosystem technical team. The FEP extension follows the process outlined in the Pacific and North Pacific of identifying a Fishery Ecosystem Issue (FEI). An example FEI addressing red tide illustrates going through FEI loop [@levin_building_2018] identifying objectives, potential indicators, and uses of the indicators to support management. The FEI steps include scoping (the where are we now step) with stakeholders to outline the issue, data available, and potential for Council management, development and execution of a workplan (where are we going), implementation with recommended research, communication, and tradeoff analysis among management options, followed by management recommendation and evaluation of the recommended actions. 

For the red tide issue, extensive scoping work is already complete, and considerable data is available for red tides. The red grouper and gag grouper stock assessments include red tide mortality, and red tide uncertainty has been considered by the SSC for these stocks. An new red tide index is currently in development by Council staff. Three index options were presented in May 2025. The red tide index was strongly associated with river discharge, highlighting environmental drivers linked to episodic fish mortality. 

![Figure 6. Work in progress developing a red tide index under the Gulf Red Tide FEI](images/redtideindexGulf.png)

Two ESRs have been produced for the Gulf, in 2013 and most recently in 2017 [@karnauskas_ecosystem_2017]. The Gulf ESR reports on climate, physical, habitat, lower and upper trophic level, ecosystem services, and human dimensions indicators, then analyzes combined trends across all of the section indicators to provide an overview of ecosystem conditions. A fish CVA was recently completed [@quinlan_results_2023], and marine mammal climate vulnerability has been assessed for the entire Atlantic Coast, including the Gulf [@lettrich_vulnerability_2023]. 

The Gulf Council is one of three regional Councils served by SEFSC, the other two are the Caribbean and South Atlantic. While SEFSC dedicates some staff resources to ecosystem reporting, resources to date have been inadequate to produce annual ecosystem reports across all three regions. However, streamlined processes and automation were developed for the Caribbean ESR that may permit more frequent updates across all regions.

Gulf Council managed fisheries are a mix of recreational and commercial. The Gulf has the highest recreational landings and expenditures of any US region. Gulf menhaden, which is managed by the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, contributes the majority of commercial landings in the region. 


### SAFMC

The South Atlantic Council manages under 8 FMPs: 4 multispecies (Coastal migratory pelagics,  Dolphin Wahoo, Shrimp, Snapper Grouper), 2 single species (Golden crab, Spiny lobster) and 2 habitat-oriented FMPs (Coral and live bottom habitat, Sargassum). The original Coral FMP was joint with the Gulf. The FMPs for Coral and Sargassum limit or prohibit commercial exploitation and promote conservation of these living habitats. 

Habitat forms the basis of ecosystem based management approaches in the South Atlantic. The South Atlantic [FEP II](https://safmc.net/documents/fishery-ecosystem-plan-2-fep-ii/) contains both extensive description of the ecosystem (>50% of 400 pages) as well as essential fish habitat (EFH) policy statements that specifically outline indicators and research to support policies. Many of these policies address cross-sectoral considerations, extending into Ecosystem Based Management (EBM). Policies and key ecosystem information include those listed in the FEP and several newer statements from https://safmc.net/fishery-management-plans/habitat/:  

* South Atlantic Food Webs and Connectivity Policy – January 2025
    +  Connects EFH and food web considerations, identifies research needs 
    +  Includes fish food habits data identifying top 10 prey by FMP
    +  Includes food web model for the South Atlantic region  
* Climate Variability and Fisheries – December 2016
    +  Connects changing ocean conditions with fish distribution shifts and changing timing, identifies research needs 
    +  Notes these shifts present challenges for management and new fishery opportunities  
    +  Requests annual summaries of climate indicators tracking ecological, social and economic trends 
    +  Requests climate vulnerability analysis and management strategy evaluation focused on climate robustness
* Marine Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) Habitat Policy – June 2014    
    +  Describes ecosystem services provided by SAV and recent declines in this EFH
    +  Outlines monitoring and research, planning, management, and education and enforcement to protect and restore SAV
    
![Figure 7. SAFMC food web](images/SAFMC_FWmodel.png)
    
The following policies identify species with EFH and HAPC potentially impacted by each activity, and identify specific threats, best management practices and research needs:
* Beach Dredging and Filling, Beach Renourishment and Large-Scale Coastal Engineering – September 2023 
* Energy Exploration, Development, Transportation and Hydropower Re-Licensing - November 2024   
* Alteration of Riverine, Estuarine and Nearshore Flows Policy – June 2014    
* Artificial Reef Habitat Policy Threats to EFH – September 2017    
* Marine and Estuarine Non-Native and Invasive Species Policy – June 2014    
* Interactions Between Essential Fish Habitats And Marine Aquaculture Policy – June 2014     

A Threats Addressed by Policies Matrix summarizing a range of ocean activities with the potential to affect EFH is included in the FEP and was updated in the [2023 Habitat Blueprint](https://safmc.net/documents/habitat-blueprint-2023/). The Blueprint updated the membership and clarified the functions of the Council's Habitat and Ecosystem Based Fishery Management Advisory Panel (HEAP), as well as identifying current information products and criteria for developing additional information products supporting habitat and ecosystem efforts.    

The Council develops [Fishery Performance Reports](https://safmc-shinyapps.shinyapps.io/FPRAll/) from its FMP Advisory Panels in association with updated stock assessments. These reports include information on landings/discard trends, management measure performance, environmental and socioeconomic influences on the fishery, and any other concerns. In 2022, The Council adjusted Fishery Performance Report discussion questions to gather information for use in allocation decisions using [Allocation Decision Trees](https://safmc.net/documents/safmc_allocationdecisiontoolblueprint_202312_final/). The adjustments specifically address species distribution shifts, fishing practices related to catch and release, and social or cultural importance. 

The South Atlantic region has a recent ESR [@craig_ecosystem_2021] and CVAs for fishery resources [@burton_climate_2023; @craig_climate_2025] and fishing communities [@seara_community_2022]. Marine mammal climate vulnerability has been assessed for the entire Atlantic Coast [@lettrich_vulnerability_2023]. These documents contain indicators that represent a starting point towards meeting the needs identified in the EFH policy documents above. 

The South Atlantic Council is one of three regional Councils served by SEFSC, the other two are the Caribbean and Gulf. While SEFSC dedicates some staff resources to ecosystem reporting, resources to date have been inadequate to produce annual ecosystem reports across all three regions. However, streamlined processes and automation were developed for the Caribbean ESR that may permit more frequent updates across all regions. 

South Atlantic fisheries are roughly evenly split between commercial and recreational. 


### Examples from other organizations

#### Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission

The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) coordinates management of fisheries shared by 15 states bordering the Atlantic Ocean. ASMFC manages a total of 27 stocks, some in partnership with the three Atlantic Councils or NOAA, and 14 species/groups under its own Interstate FMPs (ISFMPs): American Eel, American Lobster, Atlantic Croaker, Atlantic Menhaden, Atlantic Striped Bass, Atlantic Sturgeon, Black Drum, Northern Shrimp, Red Drum, Shad and River Herring, Spot, Spotted Sea Trout, Tautog, and Weakfish. 

ASMFC manages Atlantic menhaden using Ecological Reference Points (ERPs) that account for menhaden's role in the ecosystem [@anstead_path_2021; @howell_combining_2021]. The reference points are estimated from a multispecies food web model that includes menhaden and its key managed fish predator species [@chagaris_ecological_2020]. The food web model is calibrated based on current stock assessments for each managed fish species and fit to biomass and catch data used in each stock assessment. Therefore, the model assumptions about the productivity of each species match the information currently used to manage each species. Diet information from many sources is included in the model to estimate predator prey relationships. The ERP is estimated by evaluating a range of joint fishing mortalities of menhaden and its most responsive predator, striped bass, and finding the menhaden fishing mortality that maintains striped bass at its target biomass when striped bass are fished at their target fishing rate. (The model runs exploring these fishing scenarios include all the other predators and prey and their interactions, where other species are assumed to be fished at their current rates.) Once this fishing rate is found using the ecosystem model, it is translated into the menhaden single species assessment to complete short term projections of the menhaden stock including uncertainty in stock parameters.

The process leading up to this approach included a history of multispecies modeling for menhaden and a stakeholder workshop to identify ecosystem management objectives [@anstead_path_2021], the development of multiple models over a range of complexity to evaluate predator prey relationships [@drew_balancing_2021], and close collaboration between the menhaden single species assessment team and the ERP modeling team [@chagaris_ecological_2020]. 

ASMFC has in-house stock assessment resources, and has established a dedicated workgroup to continue the ERP process [@anstead_path_2021]. The ERP modeling takes advantage of existing single species stock assessment review to streamline evaluation of model inputs, which requires coordination among assessments.

# Discussion

## Synthesis across Councils

Based on this review, there are three general categories for current use of ecosystem products: FMP/indicator based, FEP/geographically based, and developing. 

The NPFMC, PFMC, MAFMC and NEFMC use species based FMPs to structure management decisions, although many species can be within a particular FMP. Annual ecosystem indicator reports are produced and presented to each Council. Ecosystem indicators have been examined and sometimes used at the full ecosystem, ecoregion (subset of area within Council jurisdiction), species, and stock levels for decision making regarding annual catch limits. These regions are characterized by high value, data rich stocks with complex quantitative assessments, although data limited stocks and species complexes are also in each region. Three of the four Councils have non-regulatory FEPs that outline ecosystem level goals and objectives and specify processes (action modules, initiatives, etc.) for each Council to turn the ecosystem plan into tangible action on a topic. 

The WPFMC and CFMC each use island based FEP/FMPs to structure decisions for species within a defined ecoregion. This management structure was designed because each island region has distinct social, economic, and ecological conditions, and conducting species assessments across all islands was never practical. Ecosystem reporting has been intermittent (WPFMC) or only recently developed (CFMC) in these regions, yet EBFM is prioritized in the management of in both regions. Human community economic, social, and cultural interactions with the ecosystem are central tenets of management. Both regions are characterized by fisheries capturing a lot of species, with many data limited fisheries and species. 

The SAFMC and GFMC are developing ecosystem processes. In each Council, species based FMPs structure decisions, although many species can be within an FMP. SAFMC is leading the other Councils in directly linking EFH and ecosystem efforts. SAFMC has a voluminous FEP and a recent ecosystem indicator report, though not annual. GFMC has a newer FEP and is currently developing Fishery Ecosystem Issues similar to the approach taken in NPFMC and PFMC, but using the conceptual framework that CFMC is applying to develop an FMP.  

Councils have a long history of learning from each other in designing and implementing ecosystem level planning. For example, the Pacific Council reviewed the Aleutian Islands, South Atlantic, and Western Pacific FEPs prior to developing its FEP. The Mid-Atlantic in turn reviewed the Pacific and other FEPs in developing its EAFM Policy Guidance Document (functionally an FEP). The North Pacific's Bering Sea FEP includes the "ecosystem initiative" approach to operationalizing aspects of EBFM, patterned on the Pacific FEP, and the developing Gulf Council FEP similarly includes Fishery Ecosystem Issues or FEIs as the basis for addressing specific ecosystem issues or goals. The island-archipelago based FEPs in the Western Pacific that are currently used for operational fishery management preceeded the Caribbean's development of island-based FMPs, replacing their the species based FMPs and setting the groundwork for geographically based EBFM. 

Iterative co-production of ecosystem data products with managers and scientists has been demonstrated to improve understanding and use of ecosystem data in fishery management [@muffley_there_2021; @tommasi_case_2021]. 

Forage fish considerations have been addressed by many Councils. Generally, Councils have taken steps to prevent new fisheries from developing on currently unmanaged resources or developed harvest control rules accounting for supporting ecological services provided by forage fishing. The ASMFC has developed ecological reference points tying forage fish harvest to predator needs. Spatial management (buffer zones around endangered species colonies/rookeries) has also been implemented. 

## Recommendations for SAFMC (Preliminary)

SAFMC is unique among Councils in explicitly linking EFH and ecosystem efforts, and in proactively bringing citizen science into its process. These advantages can be incorporated into approaches going forward. 

SAFMC shares a mix of reef-type or west coast rockfish complex-like data limited species with some high value data rich stocks, so a mix of approaches from other regional Councils may be warranted, rather than adopting a single Council's approach.

SAFMC has identified many ecosystem indicators and objectives in its EFH policy documents; evaluation of indicators currently in the South Atlantic ESR and results of the fish and community CVAs are likely to reveal matched information as a basis for moving forward.

An explicit process for developing specific ecosystem initiatives, as applied through FEPs or similar policy documents in other regions (Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, Pacific, North Pacific) may allow SAFMC to explore practical ecosystem-based management for a particular fishery or issue.
