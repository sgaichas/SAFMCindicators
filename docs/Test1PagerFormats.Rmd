A note box:

::: {.noteblock data-latex=""}
Thank you for noticing this **new notice**! Your noticing it has been noted, and *will be reported to the authorities*!
:::

:::: {.blackbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**NOTICE!**
:::

We define an R function `box_args()` to generate the arguments for the box:

```{r}
box_args <- function(
  vrulecolor = 'white',
  hrule = c('\\abLongLine', '\\abShortLine', ''),
  title = '', vrulewidth = '0pt',
  icon = 'Bomb', iconcolor = 'black'
) {
  hrule <- match.arg(hrule)
  sprintf(
    '[%s][%s][\\textbf{%s}]{%s}{\\fa%s}{%s}',
    vrulecolor, hrule, title, vrulewidth, icon, iconcolor
  )
}
```

Pass some arguments to the `awesomeblock` environment through an inline R expression:

::: {.awesomeblock data-latex="`r box_args(title = 'NOTICE!')`"}
