# North Pacific Fishery Management Council Ecosystem Processes

The North Pacific Council manages fisheries using Fishery Management Plans (FMPs): four FMPs are species-based (Groundfish, Crab, Salmon, and Scallop) and one is area-based (Arctic). FMP based management has evolved to include ecosystem indicators in the catch specification process. 

The Council has two area-based Fishery Ecosystem Plans (FEPs): Aleutians and Bering Sea. The Bering Sea FEP has "action modules" focusing on climate readiness, incorporation of local and traditional knowledge, evaluating current management alongside EBFM best practice, developing conceptual models, and alignment of Council priorities with research funding. The first two FEP action modules have been initiated. Climate readiness was ranked 2-3 out of a possible scale of 5.

## Ecosystem Data Products

**Annual Ecosystem Status Reports (ESRs):**  
*  Eastern Bering Sea  
*  Gulf of Alaska   
*  Aleutian Islands    

Reports include graphical and text report cards for each region, ecosystem assessment sections, and detailed indicator sections, with multiple appendices. 

**Ecosystem and Socio-economic Profiles (ESPs):**  
*  Alaska sablefish  
*  Eastern Bering Sea Pacific cod  
*  Eastern Bering Sea snow crab  
*  Bristol Bay red king crab  
*  Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands tanner crab  
*  Aleutian Islands Atka mackerel  
*  Gulf of Alaska pollock  
*  Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod  
*  Gulf of Alaska arrowtooth flounder  

Reports include a life history conceptual model with ecosystem drivers for each species, analysis of ecosystem and socio economic indicators, and a summary of indicator status. 

**Additional SAFE report sections:**  
*  Unmanaged forage fish  
*  Grenadiers  
*  Multispecies assessment  
*  Economic status  

**Climate vulnerability analysis**

## How are they used

ESRs, ESPs, and additional reports are included in annual Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Reports.

ESRs have been produced since 1995, and were used to adjust TAC advice down from the maximum permissible level for individual species under poor ecosystem conditions.

Risk tables are developed from ESR and ESP indicators to summarize ecosystem conditions more systematically for each stock, and catch advice is adjusted down in high risk situations.

The Bering Sea FEP formalises the use of Ecosystem Status Reports (ESR) for monitoring progress against ecosystem objectives.

## Context:

::: {.noteblock data-latex=""}
The North Pacific Council region includes multiple large marine ecosystems, a single U.S. state (Alaska) and federal waters. Stock and ecosystem areas are spatially aligned, and stock and ecosystem assessments are temporally aligned for the groundfish and crab FMPs. Commercial fisheries dominate landings.

::: {.noteblock data-latex=""}
AFSC staff produce the reports as part of their regular duties (dedicated resources), while contributors range from NOAA staff to academic researchers in the region who have varying availability or resources to update indicators. The Council's FEP Climate Change Task Force identified a need for additional resources to implement recommendations for improving climate readiness.
